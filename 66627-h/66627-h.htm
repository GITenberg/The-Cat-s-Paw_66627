<h1>THE CAT&rsquo;S PAW</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
KITTY!</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">iss Susan Baird</span> let her gaze rest on
her companion in speculative silence.
Apparently, her last jibe had failed of its
mark, judging from the man&rsquo;s unchanged expression.
With a vexed sigh she proceeded to pour out
another cup of tea.</p>

<p>They were an oddly matched pair. Miss Baird,
still erect in spite of her seventy years, her small
slight figure tucked into one corner of the carved,
throne-shaped chair which was her habitual seat
when in her library, appeared dwarfed in comparison
with the broad-shouldered, powerfully built man
who faced her across the tea table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you wish to marry my niece, Kitty,&rdquo; she
remarked. &ldquo;<i>You!</i>&rdquo; And she broke into shrill laughter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>
<p>Her companion flushed hotly. Her ridicule cut
deeper than had any of her previous comments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to marry her,&rdquo; he answered, and the
stubborn determination of his tone matched his set
features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; Miss Baird shrugged her thin shoulders.
&ldquo;You forget, my friend, that until Kitty is twenty-five
years of age, I am her legal guardian, and that
she is absolutely dependent upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You give her a home and let her work that she
may contribute to your support,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>

<p>At his words her eyes blazed in fury and her
talonlike fingers fumbled in the silver bowl for the
few pieces of sugar it contained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am her only blood relation. It is fitting and
proper that she aid me in my old age,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;My poverty,&rdquo; she paused, and a certain
dignity crept into both voice and manner, &ldquo;is my
misfortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Kitty,&rdquo; he began, but got no further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will not discuss Kitty,&rdquo; she announced with
finality. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; as he started to interrupt her.
&ldquo;Such discussion is totally unnecessary, for Kitty
will never marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For two excellent reasons.&rdquo; She spoke with
deliberation. &ldquo;Kitty shall not marry a poor man, nor
shall she marry a man with an hereditary taint.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>The man regarded her steadfastly across the table,
his strong capable hands still holding the peach
which he had been peeling. The silence lengthened,
but neither seemed inclined to break it. Suddenly,
the man laid down the peach and taking out
his handkerchief, passed it across his lips; then, still
in silence, he picked up the fruit knife, cut the peach
in two and, placing the fruit in front of Miss Baird,
rose and left the library.</p>

<p>In the outer hall he paused long enough to pick
up his hat and gloves from the table where he had
placed them upon his arrival some time before. He
had opened the front door and was about to step
outside when it occurred to him to light a cigarette.
To do so, he released his hold on the front
door. His cigarette was just commencing to draw
nicely when a current of air from an opened window
across the hall blew the door, which he had
left ajar, shut with a resounding bang.</p>

<p>As the noise vibrated through the silent house,
the man glanced nervously over his shoulder.
Evidently, it had not disturbed Miss Baird or the other
inmates of her household, for no one appeared in
the hall. He once more started to approach the
front door when he heard, through the portières in
front of the entrance to the library, Miss Baird&rsquo;s
voice raised in anger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Kitty!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Kitty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the name echoed through the silent hall, it
gave place to a scream of such intensity, such horror
that the man drew back aghast. It was some minutes
before he moved. With faltering footsteps he
retraced his way into the library and paused by the
tea table.</p>

<p>Miss Susan Baird still sat in her throne-shaped
chair, but the light fell full on her glazing eyes and
distorted features.</p>

<p>Slowly, reluctantly, the man bent nearer and
forced himself to place his hand upon her wrist.
He could feel no pulse. When he stood erect a
moment later, his forehead was beaded with perspiration.
Dazedly, he glanced about the library&mdash;he
and the dead woman were its only occupants.</p>

<p>Again he compelled himself to gaze at her, and
subconsciously took note of her poor and patched
attire. The incongruity of her string of pearls and
the diamond rings upon her fingers impressed him
even in the presence of death.</p>

<p>Step by step he retreated backward across the
room, his glance roaming upward toward the gallery
which circled the library and the short staircase
leading to it, but always his eyes returned to
that still and lonely figure by the tea table.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the faint sound of the front
door being closed disturbed a large ball of fur. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>gray Angora cat jumped from its hiding place and,
with its back arched in fright, scampered through
the portières, and fled along the hall and up the
staircase to the attic.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
THE SUMMONS</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> broad streets of Washington City presented
a lively scene as Dr. Leonard McLean
drove his car with increasing slowness
down Connecticut Avenue, crowded with government
employees hastening to their offices. The congestion
was even greater than usual owing to the
downpour of rain as the drenched pedestrians
swarmed around the street car stops in their endeavor
to board cars, already packed to their limit,
and arrive promptly at nine o&rsquo;clock at their various
destinations.</p>

<p>McLean slowed down to a stop within the fifteen
feet limit prescribed by law, as the street car ahead
of him halted to take on passengers, and watched
with interest the futile efforts of the conductor to
prevent the desperate rush made by both men and
women to get through the car door at the same time.
Suddenly, McLean discerned a familiar face in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>crowd before him and sounded his horn. The unexpected
&ldquo;honk&rdquo; created confusion among those
unable to find even clinging room, and the conductor,
taking advantage of the diversion, signaled to the
motorman and the car sped onward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Leigh!&rdquo; hailed McLean. &ldquo;Leigh Wallace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Wallace glanced around and with a wave
of his hand McLean indicated the vacant seat in his
roadster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hop in!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as Wallace hurried
across the intervening space between the car and the
curbstone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a lift downtown,&rdquo; and,
hardly waiting for Wallace to seat himself and close
the door, the busy surgeon released the clutch and
the roadster sped down Connecticut Avenue.</p>

<p>It was not until they were clear of traffic and were
approaching the intersection of Twenty-first Street
and Massachusetts Avenue that McLean realized
his companion had not returned his greeting or
addressed a word to him since entering the car. Turning
his head, he eyed him unobtrusively. Wallace
sat moodily staring ahead; his big frame, slumped
in the easiest posture, seemed to fill the broad seat
of the Packard. McLean took silent note of
Wallace&rsquo;s expression and the unhealthy pallor of his
skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get any sleep last night?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much.&rdquo; Wallace drew out a leather wallet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>from an inside pocket and produced a prescription.
&ldquo;The druggist refused to fill this again; said I had
to get another prescription. Beastly rot,&rdquo; he complained.
&ldquo;Cost me a bad night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The surgeon ran his eye over the prescription before
pocketing it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a narcotic,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;The druggists are
not allowed to refill. Next time you want one come
to me. How long is it since you left Walter Reed
Hospital, Leigh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two months ago,&rdquo; was the laconic rejoinder.
Wallace removed his hat and passed his hand over
his short-clipped hair. &ldquo;I hope to report for duty
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; McLean slowed down to make the turn
from Twenty-first Street into Massachusetts Avenue
and as they drove westward Major Wallace for the
first time took notice of the direction in which they
were heading and that they were no longer on Connecticut
Avenue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to your office, McLean?&rdquo; he
inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not immediately. I have a professional call to
make first. Are you in a hurry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question seemed superfluous and McLean
smiled as he put it. The major&rsquo;s apathetic manner
and relaxed figure could not be associated with
haste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Wallace answered. &ldquo;I promised to stop
in and see Charles Craige some time this morning;
he&rsquo;s attending to some legal business for me. Otherwise
I have nothing to do. This killing time gets
on my nerves&mdash;look at that, now,&rdquo; and he held up a
hand that was not quite steady. &ldquo;Take me on as
chauffeur, McLean. I understand an engine; shell-shock
hasn&rsquo;t knocked that out of my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your head&rsquo;s all right, old man. I told you that
when you were my patient at Walter Reed,&rdquo; responded
McLean cheerily. &ldquo;A few weeks more
and&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped speaking as they crossed the Q
Street bridge into Georgetown, then, stepping on the
accelerator, he raced the car up the steeply graded
street and drew up in front of a high terrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, are you going to &lsquo;Rose Hill&rsquo;?&rdquo; demanded
Wallace, wakened from his lethargy by the stopping
of the car. He had apparently been unaware that
McLean had left his last sentence unfinished. &ldquo;Who
is ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; McLean leaned back to pick up
his instrument bag which he carried in the compartment
behind his seat. &ldquo;My servant called to me
just as I was leaving home that I had been telephoned
to come over here at once. I didn&rsquo;t catch all she
said. I suppose Kitty Baird is ill. That girl is a
bundle of nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wallace clambered out of the car so that his more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>nimble companion would not have to climb over his
long legs in getting out. As McLean turned to close
the door of his car, Wallace&rsquo;s hand descended
heavily upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;who&mdash;who&rsquo;s that standing in the Baird&rsquo;s
doorway?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;A policeman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>McLean swung around and glanced up at the
house. A long flight of stone steps led up to the
front door and a landing marked each break in the
terrace whereon grew rosebushes. It was the picturesque
garden which gave its name to the fine old
mansion&mdash;Rose Hill. The mansion had been built
in colonial times when the surrounding land, on
which stood modern houses and the present-day
streets, had been part of the &ldquo;plantation&rdquo; owned by
General Josiah Baird of Revolutionary fame. The
hand of progress had left the mansion perched high
above the graded street, but it had not touched its
fine air of repose, nor diminished the beauty of its
classic Greek architecture.</p>

<p>Standing under the fanlight over the doorway
was the burly form of a blue-coated policeman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s one of the &lsquo;City&rsquo;s finest,&rsquo;&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; he added, observing his companion&rsquo;s
agitation in astonishment. &ldquo;The policeman is probably
taking the census; one called on me last Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Wallace swallowed hard. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he mumbled,
rather than spoke. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McLean, conscious of the bleak wind which accompanied
the driving rain, stopped to open the
door of his roadster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait in the car, Leigh; I won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo; Not
pausing to see if his suggestion was followed, McLean
hurried up the steps.</p>

<p>Wallace plucked at the collar of his overcoat and
opened it with nervous fingers, mechanically closed
the car door, and then with slow reluctant feet followed
McLean toward the mansion. He was breathing
heavily when he gained the surgeon&rsquo;s side, and
the latter&rsquo;s surprised exclamation at sight of him
was checked by the policeman who had advanced a
few steps to meet the two men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. McLean?&rdquo; he asked, and as the surgeon
nodded, added, &ldquo;Step inside, Sir.&rdquo; He touched his
hat respectfully. &ldquo;Is this gentleman with you,
Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly.&rdquo; McLean glanced inquiringly
at the policeman; the latter&rsquo;s manner indicated suppressed
excitement. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to pay, Officer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll tell you inside,&rdquo; waving his hand toward
the open door. &ldquo;The coroner&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coroner!&rdquo; McLean&rsquo;s bag nearly slipped from
his hand; but before he could question the policeman
further, his name was called from the back of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>hall and he hurried inside the house. Coroner Penfield
stood by the portières in front of the library
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you could get here so promptly, McLean,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; and he drew the portières
to one side. McLean entered the library hastily
and continued to advance with his usual brisk tread
until he caught sight of a huddled figure in the
throne-shaped chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he ejaculated and retreated a few
steps. Recovering his usual calm poise he walked
around the tea table and examined the body. When
he straightened up and turned around, he found
Coroner Penfield&rsquo;s attention was centered on Major
Leigh Wallace.</p>

<p>Wallace had followed McLean across the threshold
of the library only, and stood with his back
braced against the doorjamb while his eyes mutely
scrutinized every movement made by the surgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he questioned, and McLean&rsquo;s stare grew
intensified. If he had not seen Wallace&rsquo;s lips move
he would never have recognized his voice. With
difficulty Wallace enunciated his words. &ldquo;Well&mdash;what&mdash;what
is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a case of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sudden death.&rdquo; Coroner Penfield completed
McLean&rsquo;s sentence.</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, a man who had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>leaning over the railing of the gallery which circled
the library, watching them, walked over to the stairs
and came slowly down. At sound of his footsteps
McLean glanced up and recognized Inspector
Mitchell of the Central Office. He bowed courteously
to the surgeon before addressing the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is all right, Dr. Penfield, we&rsquo;ll have the body
removed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My men are here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Call them.&rdquo; Penfield turned to McLean.
&ldquo;I wanted you to be present as I understand
you attended Miss Susan Baird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have been her family physician for years.&rdquo;
McLean spoke with an effort, his thoughts centered
on one idea. &ldquo;Where is Miss Baird&rsquo;s niece, Miss
Kitty Baird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His question went unanswered. Apparently
Coroner Penfield and Inspector Mitchell failed to
hear him as they busied themselves in superintending
the removal of the body. McLean, after watching
them for some seconds, walked over to Wallace.
The latter took no notice of him whatever, his eyes
remaining always on the tea table. McLean scanned
his drawn face and listened to his labored breathing
with growing concern. Whirling around, he opened
his bag, took out a flask, detached its silver cup and
poured out a liberal allowance of whisky, then, darting
out of the library, he returned an instant later
with some water in a glass. Slightly diluting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>whisky, he thrust the cup against Wallace&rsquo;s white
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink that,&rdquo; he ordered, and Wallace followed
his peremptory command. &ldquo;Now, sit down,&rdquo; and
he half-pushed, half-supported him to a large leather
covered lounge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I,&rdquo; protested Wallace. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit undone,
McLean,&rdquo; and he raised miserable, apologetic eyes
to his friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s enough to bowl any one over,&rdquo; McLean
acknowledged, with a sympathetic pat. &ldquo;Even the
strongest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which I am not,&rdquo; supplemented Wallace. The
powerful stimulant was taking effect, and he spoke
with more composure. &ldquo;Have you&mdash;can you&mdash;&rdquo; he
hesitated, and cast a sidelong glance at McLean.
&ldquo;Can you learn any details about Miss Baird and
how she came to be lying in that chair?&rdquo; It was impossible
for him to suppress a shudder as he indicated
the empty throne-shaped chair. &ldquo;She was
dead, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As dead as a door nail.&rdquo; His question was answered
by Inspector Mitchell, who had returned in
time to catch their last few remarks. &ldquo;Can you
give me any facts about Miss Baird, Doctor McLean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only that she was a lifelong resident of Georgetown
and a well-known character&mdash;known for her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>eccentricities, that is,&rdquo; responded McLean. &ldquo;Her
death has come as a great shock to Major Wallace
and to me, Inspector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you see her last?&rdquo; inquired Mitchell.
His question was addressed to both men, but it was
McLean who answered it after a moment&rsquo;s thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was in my office on Friday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was she ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. For a woman of her age she was remarkably
free from organic trouble,&rdquo; replied McLean.
&ldquo;In fact, she did not come to consult me about herself
at all, but to ask for a tonic for her niece. By
the way, where is Miss Kitty Baird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the question Wallace raised his head and eyed
the surgeon intently for a second, then dropped his
eyes as the other felt his gaze and turned toward
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Miss Kitty Baird?&rdquo; Mitchell repeated
the surgeon&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;Blessed if I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; McLean started from the chair where
he had seated himself a moment before. &ldquo;Do you
mean to say that Miss Kitty Baird is not in her
bedroom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; Mitchell shook a puzzled head. &ldquo;And
she isn&rsquo;t in any part of the house. My men and I
have searched it thoroughly. We found only the
dead woman in the house and a live Angora cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McLean stared at the inspector in dumbfounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>amazement. A gurgling sound from the sofa caused
him to look at Wallace. The major, with purpling
face, was struggling to undo his collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Air! Air!&rdquo; he gasped, and before the surgeon
could spring to his aid, he sank back unconscious
against the sofa pillows.</p>

DETAILS</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">nspector</span> Mitchell and Dr. McLean watched
the taxicab, in which rode Major Leigh Wallace
and Coroner Penfield, until it passed out
of sight on its way to Washington, before reëntering
the Baird mansion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Major Wallace seems in bad shape,&rdquo; commented
Mitchell, as they crossed the hall toward the library.
&ldquo;I thought you would never bring him back to consciousness,
Doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This library wasn&rsquo;t a pleasant sight for well man
to encounter, Mitchell, let alone a man in the major&rsquo;s
condition,&rdquo; replied McLean. &ldquo;The results of shell-shock
do not exactly prepare a man for this&mdash;&rdquo; and
with a wave of his hand the surgeon indicated the
tea table and the throne-shaped chair where Miss
Baird&rsquo;s body had lain on their entrance three quarters
of an hour before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, yes; but I should have thought the major&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>experiences overseas would have accustomed him to
gruesome scenes.&rdquo; Mitchell paused in front of
the portières and adjusted them carefully so that
they completely covered the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walking into a room and finding a friend lying
dead is a shock, regardless of any past experience,&rdquo;
responded McLean dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Major Wallace know Miss Baird well?&rdquo;
inquired Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know her well?&rdquo; repeated McLean. &ldquo;Yes, and
her niece, Kitty Baird, even better, if rumor speaks
truly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A certain inflection in the surgeon&rsquo;s voice caused
Mitchell to eye him sharply, but McLean&rsquo;s attention
was entirely centered on the tea table before which
he was standing, and he appeared unaware of the
inspector&rsquo;s scrutiny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly what do you mean, Doctor?&rdquo; asked the
latter. &ldquo;Your words would imply&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;except that rumor has it that Leigh
Wallace and Kitty Baird are engaged to be married.&rdquo;
McLean balanced one hand on a chair and
tipped it back and forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is your <i>personal</i> opinion, Doctor?&rdquo;
asked Mitchell shrewdly.</p>

<p>McLean hesitated. &ldquo;I am not quite so certain,&rdquo;
he admitted. &ldquo;Three months ago I believed Wallace
and Kitty were engaged; then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&mdash;&rdquo; as McLean paused once more in his
speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Kitty met Edward Rodgers of San Francisco,&rdquo;
McLean smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a toss-up which man
wins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So.&rdquo; The inspector considered a moment. &ldquo;So
Miss Baird is still willing to take a chance on marrying
Major Wallace, is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; McLean&rsquo;s abstracted manner
disappeared instantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly like my daughter to
marry him,&rdquo; retorted Mitchell. &ldquo;Not after seeing
his condition here to-day. I haven&rsquo;t much medical
knowledge&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo; The surgeon&rsquo;s dry tone caused
Mitchell to redden. &ldquo;I can assure you, Mitchell, that
Major Wallace&rsquo;s ill-health is but temporary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; Mitchell eyed him reflectively, then as
an idea occurred to him his expression altered. &ldquo;By
Jove! Perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t the sight of Miss Baird
lying there dead which knocked him out, but the
absence of her niece, Miss Kitty Baird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McLean let the chair, which he had been balancing
on two legs, go slowly back to its proper position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just possible that you are right,&rdquo; he agreed.
&ldquo;Kitty Baird&rsquo;s absence has alarmed me also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so? You kept mighty calm about it,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>grumbled Mitchell. McLean was not evincing much
interest. &ldquo;Possibly you don&rsquo;t realize that Miss
Baird did not die a natural death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McLean smiled ironically. &ldquo;You pay me a poor
compliment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I only made a superficial
examination of her body, but it assured me that
a&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated for a brief second, &ldquo;that a tragedy
had occurred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tragedy!&rdquo; In fine scorn. &ldquo;Why mince words?
Say murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; McLean spoke with provoking deliberation.
&ldquo;Suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suicide!&rdquo; echoed the inspector. &ldquo;Bah! Look
at this room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obediently McLean glanced about the library. It
was a large room, almost square in shape, two
stories in height with an arched roof containing a
stained glass skylight. It was paneled in Flemish
oak; and oak bookcases, with sliding glass doors,
filled most of the wall space, while a gallery, on a
level with the second story, circled the library. Access
to the gallery was gained from the library by a
flight of circular steps near the huge brick chimney
which stood at the farther end of the room. Bookcases,
similar in type to those on the main floor of
the library, were in the gallery, and McLean scarcely
glanced upward; instead, his eyes roved over the
worn furniture with its shabby upholstery, the faded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>rugs on the hardwood floor, until finally his gaze
rested on the tea table. Given to observation of little
things, he noticed the spotless condition of the tea
cloth and the neat darns in one corner. Inspector
Mitchell observed his silent contemplation of the
tea table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently Miss Baird was enjoying a cup of
tea,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;See, her cup is half full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you analyzed its contents?&rdquo; asked McLean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; Mitchell moved impatiently. &ldquo;Give
us time, Doctor. It won&rsquo;t take long to locate the
criminal. He is sure to have left a clue behind
him among the tea things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will insist on murder!&rdquo; McLean shrugged
his shoulders. &ldquo;I see only one cup of tea,&rdquo; pointing
to the table. &ldquo;A teapot&mdash;is it empty?&rdquo; He stretched
out his hand to pick it up, but Mitchell checked him
with an imperative gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t handle anything, Sir,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;We
are making tests for finger prints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right.&rdquo; McLean&rsquo;s hand dropped to his
side. &ldquo;Well, murder presupposes the presence of
some one beside the victim. I see only one teacup,
one plate with two sandwiches and a piece of cake,
another plate with a half-eaten peach. Not a very
bountiful repast. Now, while Miss Baird was poor,
she was hospitable, inspector; had any one been here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>her visitor would have been provided with a cup
of tea at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;but suppose she wasn&rsquo;t aware of the,
er, visitor&rsquo;s presence?&rdquo; asked Mitchell.</p>

<p>McLean eyed him in silence for a second. &ldquo;Have
you found any indication of another&rsquo;s presence?&rdquo;
he questioned. &ldquo;Any clues?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing worth mentioning now,&rdquo; responded
Mitchell, evasively. &ldquo;Can you give me the name of
an intimate friend to whom Miss Baird may have
gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly; there&rsquo;s&mdash;let me see&mdash;&rdquo; McLean
pulled himself up short. Who were Kitty Baird&rsquo;s
intimate friends&mdash;her girl friends? He could
enumerate dozens of men whose admiration for her was
sincere and unconcealed, but when it came to the
girls in their set&mdash;pshaw! women were cats! Kitty&rsquo;s
popularity had not endeared her to her own sex.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might try Mrs. Amos Parsons,&rdquo; he suggested,
and pointed to the telephone table in a corner
of the library. &ldquo;Kitty is her private secretary. No,
wait,&rdquo; as Mitchell snatched up the telephone book
and hastily turned its well-thumbed pages. &ldquo;She
may be with her cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Ben Potter.
Here, I&rsquo;ll look up their number for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell hung up the receiver in disgust a minute
later. &ldquo;Central declares no one answers,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;Who shall we try next? Mrs. Parsons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>did you say?&rdquo; This time he was more successful
in getting the number desired, but the reply to his
question was unsatisfactory. &ldquo;The butler declares
Miss Baird hasn&rsquo;t been there since yesterday,&rdquo; he
told his companion. &ldquo;Mrs. Parsons is not at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McLean&rsquo;s expression had grown serious. &ldquo;We
had better communicate with Charles Craige,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Craige has handled Miss Baird&rsquo;s affairs for
years, lawyer, agent, and all that. He may aid us in
locating Kitty.&rdquo; Then with a touch of impatience,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop to look up the number of his law office&mdash;it
is Main 3300.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Inspector Mitchell turned again to the telephone,
McLean rose and slowly paced back and forth
the length of the library. His familiarity with the
furnishings and the contents of the bookcases&mdash;his
taste in literature having coincided with that of Colonel
Baird, who spent the last years of his life
squandering a depleted fortune to gratify his craving
as a collector&mdash;caused him to pay little attention
to his surroundings, and he walked with head bent,
his thoughts with the dead woman upstairs.</p>

<p>Was Inspector Mitchell right&mdash;could it have been
murder? Who would have reason to harm so feeble
an old lady? What motive could have inspired such
a senseless crime? Robbery&mdash;bah, thieves would
not kill to secure books and knickknacks of doubtful
value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>But then what motive could have prompted suicide?
Why should a woman so near the grave take
her own life? Miss Baird had abhorred illness in
any form; she had always had a healthy distaste for
invalidism, and little patience with neurotic friends.</p>

<p>Miss Susan Baird, of all persons, to be found
dead&mdash;possibly murdered! McLean took out his
handkerchief and passed it over his forehead. For
the first time he grew conscious of the closeness of
the atmosphere, of the musty smell which dampness
sometimes engenders. Instinctively, he stopped in
front of a side door which opened on a &ldquo;stoop&rdquo; leading
to the garden which extended to the back of the
house. The door resisted his attempts to open it,
and he felt for the key. It was not in the lock.</p>

<p>McLean stared at the door in some surprise. It
was the only one in the house fitted with a modern
lock, and it had always been Miss Baird&rsquo;s custom to
leave the key in the lock. The locks of the other
doors were hand-wrought before the Revolution
and massive in size. It had been Miss Baird&rsquo;s fad
never to have them modernized. One of her few
extravagances, if it could be called such, had been to
employ a grandson of old &ldquo;Oscar,&rdquo; their colored
factotum, to keep the copper highly burnished and
shining with its old-time, slave-day luster. The
great fireplaces were lined with copper and Miss
Baird was never happier than when able to contem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>plate
her grotesque reflection in the walls of the fireplace
in her library.</p>

<p>McLean had been a frequent visitor at the Baird
mansion, but never before had he seen the key removed
from the side door of the library. With a
puzzled frown he reached up and pulled back the
copper latch which released the upper half of the
door&mdash;built in the style of the &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; door&mdash;and
pulled it back. The fresh air, laden as it was with
dampness, was refreshing. The rain had slackened,
and seeing there was no danger of it splashing inside
the library, he pulled the half door still further
open. Turning about, he found Inspector Mitchell
at his elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I caught Mr. Craige,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;He is
coming right over.&rdquo; Then with a complete change
of tone. &ldquo;How did you open the upper half of this
door?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By pushing the catch, so&mdash;&rdquo; and McLean demonstrated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hump!&rdquo; Inspector Mitchell moved the catch
back and forth. &ldquo;I see, there&rsquo;s a knack about it; it
baffled me when I tried to open it. I have the key
of the lower door,&rdquo; and he drew it out of his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you take it out of the lock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; Inspector Mitchell&rsquo;s answer was interrupted
by the sudden rush of feet across the
outer hall. The portières were thrust aside and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>a girl dashed into the library followed by a man.</p>

<p>Utterly oblivious of the inspector&rsquo;s presence, she
sped across the room to McLean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Doctor, is it true?&rdquo; she gasped, incoherently.
&ldquo;Is Aunt Susan&mdash;has she&mdash;&rdquo; She faltered and McLean
caught her outstretched hands and drew her
into a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, and his quiet, controlled tone
brought some measure of relief to the overwrought
girl. &ldquo;Your aunt is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty Baird&rsquo;s head dropped forward and rested on
her cupped hands, and tears forced their way
through her fingers. At the sound of her weeping,
a seven-toed Angora cat stole out from behind a
piece of furniture and pattered across the floor.
With a flying leap she seated herself in Kitty&rsquo;s lap
and brushed her head against the girl&rsquo;s hands. Kitty
looked down, caught the soft body in her arms and
held the cat tightly to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mouchette, Mouchette,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Aunty&rsquo;s
gone&mdash;gone,&rdquo; and she buried her face in the long
fur. Gradually, her sobs grew less, and McLean,
observing that she was regaining some hold on her
composure, withdrew to the other end of the library
where Inspector Mitchell was holding a low-toned
conversation with Charles Craige.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you are here, Craige,&rdquo; McLean said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>keeping his voice lowered. &ldquo;This is the devil of a
mess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer&rsquo;s handsome face expressed grave
concern. &ldquo;So I judge from what Inspector Mitchell
told me on the telephone and what he has just said.&rdquo;
He moved so as to catch a better view of the library.
&ldquo;Where have you taken Miss Baird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To her bedroom,&rdquo; replied Mitchell. &ldquo;The autopsy
will be held this afternoon probably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had not troubled to lower his rather strident
voice and his words reached Kitty&rsquo;s ears. Dropping
the cat, she sprang to her feet with a slight cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Autopsy?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;No, not that!&rdquo; And
she put up her hand as if to ward off a blow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Mitchell, and as Kitty
hesitated, McLean spoke quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is customary in cases of sudden death, Kitty,
to hold autopsies,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Your aunt was
found dead in this room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Kitty looked about with a shudder. &ldquo;I
did not realize&mdash;Mr. Craige only told me&mdash;we met at
the door,&rdquo; she pulled herself up short, waited a moment,
then continued with more composure. &ldquo;I
understood that aunty had died suddenly. It has
been a great shock,&rdquo; she looked piteously from one
to the other. &ldquo;I have lived with aunty ever since I
can remember&mdash;and now to be without her!&rdquo; She
again paused to steady her voice. &ldquo;Oh, it seems im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>possible
that she is dead; she was so alive&mdash;so
anxious to live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inspector Mitchell cocked an eager eye at McLean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she wanted to live, Miss,&rdquo; he commented.
&ldquo;Never expressed any wish to end her life, did she,
Miss Baird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; Kitty stared at him in astonishment.
&ldquo;What put such an idea into your head?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t ever in <i>my</i> head,&rdquo; Mitchell retorted.
&ldquo;Dr. McLean is responsible for the theory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty turned and looked directly at McLean.
Tears were still very near the deep blue eyes, and
her cheeks had lost their wonted color, but as she
faced the three men they were conscious of her
beauty. Slightly above medium height, she looked
taller owing to her straight and graceful carriage.
McLean sighed involuntarily. He dreaded a scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Doctor, what made you think Aunt Susan
wished to die?&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s voice rose. &ldquo;You told me
only last week that she was in excellent health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I did.&rdquo; McLean spoke in haste. &ldquo;Your
aunt was in good health, Kitty; but, eh, the circumstances
of her death&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;The circumstances of her
death,&rdquo; she repeated slowly, and paused as if seeking
a word, &ldquo;were they not&mdash;natural?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Baird, they were not,&rdquo; broke in In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>spector
Mitchell, anxious to have the floor. &ldquo;We
found your aunt dead in this library about two hours
ago. Dr. McLean examined her body; he can tell
you from what she died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty looked in mute question at McLean while
her trembling hands plucked aimlessly at her damp
handkerchief. The surgeon impulsively put his arm
about her shoulder before speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your aunt died from a dose of poison,&rdquo; he stated
slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poison!&rdquo; Kitty reeled and but for McLean&rsquo;s
strong arm would have fallen. Dumbly, she stared
at the three men. &ldquo;Aunt Susan poisoned! By
whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not know that&mdash;yet,&rdquo; replied Mitchell,
and the tone of his voice chilled Kitty. It was some
seconds before she could speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What poisoned her?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The exact nature of the poison will be determined
by the autopsy,&rdquo; broke in McLean. &ldquo;The
coroner&rsquo;s examination of the body and mine were
superficial, but it did establish the fact that your
aunt had swallowed poison.&rdquo; He caught the terror
which flashed into Kitty&rsquo;s eyes, and added impulsively,
&ldquo;Miss Baird, in a moment of insanity, may
have committed suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go again, Doctor.&rdquo; Mitchell laughed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>shortly. &ldquo;Now, Miss Baird, where did you spend
last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With my cousin, Nina Potter, and her husband,
at their apartment in Sixteenth Street,&rdquo; Kitty spoke
mechanically. Turning about she walked stiffly over
to a chair and sank into it. She wondered if her
companions were aware of her trembling knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; Charles Craige&rsquo;s charmingly modulated
voice sounded soothingly to her overwrought nerves.
&ldquo;I would have prepared you for this had I known,&rdquo;
he hesitated, &ldquo;these details. But Inspector Mitchell
only telephoned to me that your aunt was dead, and
it was not until we both came in that I learned, as
you have, of the tragedy. I grieve with you, dear
child; your aunt was my good friend for many
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty looked up at him gratefully. She was very
fond of her handsome godfather. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
she murmured. &ldquo;I feel stunned.&rdquo; She pressed her
fingers against her temples. &ldquo;Oh, poor aunty&mdash;to
die here alone! Why, why didn&rsquo;t I get up early and
come here at once without waiting for breakfast?
I might have saved her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McLean moved uneasily and exchanged glances
with Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t reproach yourself, Kitty,&rdquo; he begged.
&ldquo;Your presence here this morning would not have
saved your aunt,&rdquo; and as she looked at him in aston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>ishment,
he added more slowly, &ldquo;judging from the
condition of the body, your aunt died fully twenty
hours ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charles Craig broke the silence. &ldquo;Twenty hours
ago,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;That would be yesterday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sunday afternoon, to be exact,&rdquo; stated Inspector
Mitchell. &ldquo;When did you leave here, Miss Baird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday afternoon, about three o&rsquo;clock; no,
nearly four,&rdquo; Kitty corrected herself with a haste
not lost upon the inspector.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when did you last see your aunt alive?&rdquo;
he questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About that time.&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s foot tapped restlessly
against the rug. &ldquo;She was in her bedroom, and I
called to her as I went down the staircase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say to her?&rdquo; Mitchell was taking
mental note of Kitty&rsquo;s well-groomed appearance
and her nervous handling of her handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told her not to sit up late.&rdquo; Kitty did not meet
the inspector&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Aunt Susan seldom went to
bed before one or two o&rsquo;clock in the morning; she
claimed it rested her to sit up and read in the library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were the servants here when you left the
house?&rdquo; asked Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Servants?&rdquo; A ghost of a smile touched Kitty&rsquo;s
lips. &ldquo;Aunty would not employ any one but old
Oscar. He never comes until about seven in the
morning, and leaves immediately after dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And was it your custom to leave your aunt alone
in the house at night?&rdquo; Mitchell was blind to the
heavy frown with which McLean listened to his
continued questioning of Kitty. The surgeon
guessed the tension she was under and dreaded a
breakdown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Occasionally, yes.&rdquo; Observing Mitchell&rsquo;s expression,
Kitty added hastily, &ldquo;Why not? Aunt
Susan feared no one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she was murdered.&rdquo; Inspector Mitchell
eyed her keenly; then glanced at his companions&mdash;both
men were watching Kitty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or killed herself&mdash;&rdquo; Kitty spoke with an effort.
&ldquo;How did you learn of my aunt&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inspector Mitchell seemed not to hear the question
and Kitty repeated it more peremptorily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We received a telephone message, at Headquarters,&rdquo;
he stated finally. &ldquo;I was in the office at the
time and came over to investigate.&rdquo; He paused
dramatically. &ldquo;We found your aunt sitting dead in
that chair.&rdquo; He walked over and touched the
throne-shaped chair. Kitty did not follow him except
with her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you get in?&rdquo; asked Craige, walking
toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We found the key of the front door in the lock
<i>on the outside</i>,&rdquo; replied Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Kitty sprang to her feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Odd, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Mitchell was watching her
closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; briefly. Kitty paused in thought. &ldquo;What
was the nature of the message you received over the
telephone, Inspector?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To come at once to &lsquo;Rose Hill,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mitchell spoke
with impressiveness. &ldquo;That a crime had been committed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; Kitty took a step in his direction,
but before she could speak again, Mitchell held
up his hand for silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I understand, Miss Baird, that you and
your aunt occupied this house alone at night?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you left here between three and four o&rsquo;clock
on Sunday&mdash;yesterday afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the last time you saw your aunt she was
alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you employ a female servant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inspector Mitchell regarded the girl in silence.
She bore his scrutiny with outward composure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Baird,&rdquo; he spoke slowly, weighing his
words. &ldquo;I took the message over the telephone to
come at once to &lsquo;Rose Hill&rsquo;&mdash;that a crime had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>committed here. The message was given by a
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty stared at him uncomprehendingly, dumbly;
then, before they could detain her, she fled from the
library and rushing upstairs, dashed into her room,
locked the door, and flung herself face downward
on the bed.</p>

SUICIDE?</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> reception was in full swing and Mrs.
Amos Parsons contemplated her crowded
drawing room in a spirit of happy self-congratulation.
She had just welcomed a newly
accredited ambassador and introduced a Cabinet
officer to the ambassador&rsquo;s charming wife and she
felt that her feet were at last securely placed upon
the ladder of success. The scene was typical of the
national Capital. The World War had rudely interrupted
the &ldquo;calling&rdquo; days of the hostesses of
Washington, but with the advent of peace a return
had been made to old customs, and &ldquo;teas&rdquo; were again
taking their accepted place in the social calendar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A penny for your thoughts,&rdquo; said a masculine
voice over her shoulder and glancing around Mrs.
Parsons found Charles Craige at her elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You offer a penny too much,&rdquo; laughed Mrs.
Parsons. &ldquo;They were idle thoughts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About the idle rich.&rdquo; Craig looked at her with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>admiration. &ldquo;Upon my word, Cecilia, you grow
prettier every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happiness is a great &lsquo;beautifier,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons
glanced up at him with a strange, new shyness; then
quickly veiled her eyes that he might not read her
thoughts too plainly. Under pretense of arranging
the bouquet, his gift, which she was carrying, Craige
pressed her hand. His marked attention to the fascinating
widow had aroused the interest of their
circle of friends, and the prospect of the announcement
of their engagement had formed the topic of
conversation on numerous occasions.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the arrival of guests and Mrs.
Parsons imperceptibly edged toward an alcove.
Many curious glances were cast in their direction by
both men and women who stood chatting in groups
about the long drawing room. They made a striking
tableau&mdash;Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; delicate beauty enhanced by
a perfectly fitting modish gown, and Charles Craige,
standing tall and straight beside her, his iron-grey
hair and ruddy complexion adding distinction to his
appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world and his wife are here this afternoon,
Cecilia,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your tea is an unqualified success.
And every one is lingering,&rdquo; glancing down
the room. &ldquo;That is a sure sign that they are enjoying
themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except Major Wallace.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>his attention to a man worming his way between the
groups of people. &ldquo;He appears to avoid his
friends&mdash;there, he has cut Nina Potter dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a caddish thing to do!&rdquo; Craige spoke
with warmth as he saw Mrs. Potter shrink back and
her half-extended hand drop to her side. Turning
quickly, she slipped behind two women and disappeared
from their sight. Walking moodily ahead,
Leigh Wallace found himself face to face with his
hostess and Charles Craige.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not leaving so early, surely?&rdquo; she exclaimed as
he put out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I just dropped in for a minute,&rdquo; Wallace
explained, and he made no effort to conceal the indifference
of his tone. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel very fit this
afternoon, so you must excuse me. Good evening,
Craige,&rdquo; and he turned abruptly and left them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all uncivil people!&rdquo; observed Mrs. Parsons,
much incensed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last invitation he gets
to my house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look well,&rdquo; Craige remarked thoughtfully.
&ldquo;I presume he and Kitty Baird have had another
quarrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he has no right to vent his ill-humor on
me or my guests.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons was not pacified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope Kitty decides to marry Ted Rogers and
not Leigh Wallace.&rdquo; Craige looked grave. &ldquo;It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>would be a far more suitable match, although I understand
Rodgers is not wealthy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rodgers was here a moment ago.&rdquo; Mrs.
Parsons raised her lorgnette and glanced about her.
&ldquo;He asked particularly for Kitty. Where in the
world is she? She was to pour tea for me this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you not heard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard?&rdquo; Attracted by the alteration in Craige&rsquo;s
voice, Mrs. Parsons looked at him. &ldquo;Heard what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Kitty&rsquo;s aunt, Miss Susan Baird, was found
dead this morning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons retreated a step
in shocked surprise. &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Sutherland, so glad
to see you. You know Mr. Craige, of course.&rdquo; As
the newcomer and the lawyer exchanged greetings,
Mrs. Parsons saw Nina Potter and started toward
her, but several guests claimed her attention and
when she looked around Nina had vanished.</p>

<p>The room which served Benjamin Potter as a
combination workshop and library was at the other
end of the apartment which the elderly naturalist
had leased upon his marriage to Nina Underwood
six months before. The apartment house, one of
those erected to meet the demands for housing
wealthy war-workers who thronged the national
Capital during the winter of 1917-1918, had but one
apartment to each floor, and Potter had been grati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>fied
by having the best room, from his point of view,
set aside for his exclusive use by his bride.</p>

<p>Mrs. Potter had also seen to it that the furniture
was of the finest mahogany, the filing and specimen
cases of the most approved models, while the leather-seated
chairs and lounges added greatly to the comfort
of the occupants of the room. No expense had
been spared and for the first time in his hard-working,
studious life, Ben Potter had found himself surrounded
with every comfort which money could
purchase.</p>

<p>Potter&rsquo;s marriage to his pretty stenographer had
been a severe shock to several impecunious relatives
and a nine days&rsquo; wonder to his small world. He had
taken the surprised comments and sometimes belated
congratulations of both relatives and friends
with the same placid good nature which characterized
all his actions. Nina, with a tact for which she
had not been credited, went out of her way to cultivate
his friends, and if she felt the chilly reception
accorded her, never by word or manner betrayed the
fact.</p>

<p>Seated alone in his room and absorbed in his
book, Potter was oblivious of the lengthening
shadows and was only recalled to his surroundings
by the opening of the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; he asked testily. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>sight of his wife, his expression brightened. &ldquo;I did
not expect you home so soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon?&rdquo; Nina laughed softly, as she brushed
his unruly gray hair back from his forehead. &ldquo;Have
you no idea of the time? It is nearly six o&rsquo;clock,
and you should not be reading with only one light
turned on. Doctor McLean must talk to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter made a wry face. &ldquo;I would rather listen
to you than any doctor,&rdquo; he said and pulled forward
a chair close to his own. &ldquo;Tell me, have you had a
pleasant time at Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; tea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does one ever have a pleasant time at a tea?&rdquo;
Nina&rsquo;s gesture was eloquent. &ldquo;Where are your
matches, dear?&rdquo;&mdash;fumbling, as she spoke, with her
cigarette case.</p>

<p>Potter frowned slightly as he located a match box
under the tumbled papers on his desk and struck a
light for her. He had never been able to master his
dislike to women smoking, in spite of his staunch belief
that his pretty wife was always right in everything
she did. Reading his expression like a book,
Nina slipped her hand inside his and leaned against
his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very lonely going about without you,&rdquo; she
murmured. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t enjoy myself a bit when you
remain at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter turned and kissed the soft cheek so near
his own. &ldquo;My holiday is over,&rdquo; he answered, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>putting out his foot touched a packing case, its contents
partly spread on the floor in an untidy pile.
&ldquo;I cannot neglect my work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will never be accused of that,&rdquo; with flattering
emphasis. &ldquo;But, dear, I need&mdash;want your society
more than these dreadful reptiles,&rdquo; and she made a
slight grimace as she glanced at the bottles containing
specimens preserved in alcohol which adorned
the shelves of a cabinet near at hand. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo;
lowering her voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m selfish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love your selfishness, dear,&rdquo; he replied, and
held her closely to him just as a tap sounded on the
door. &ldquo;Confound it! Come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Japanese servant, who answered his command,
bowed profoundly, and his calm gaze never
flickered at sight of the loverlike attitude of husband
and wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You home, Sir?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, I&rsquo;m home. What of it?&rdquo; Potter
dropped his arm from about his wife&rsquo;s waist in embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rodgers call upon you.&rdquo; The Japanese
spoke without haste. &ldquo;You see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Bring him here,&rdquo; and at the words
Moto vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; echoed Nina. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a bit untidy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of it? He hasn&rsquo;t come to see us,&rdquo; he
grumbled. &ldquo;Probably thinks Kitty is here. I don&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>approve of Kitty playing fast and loose with those
two men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What men?&rdquo; Nina was not looking at her husband,
and missed his keen scrutiny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ted Rodgers and Leigh Wallace,&rdquo; briefly. &ldquo;If
it goes on much longer, I will speak to Cousin Susan
Baird. Hello, what did you do that for?&rdquo; as the
room was suddenly plunged in darkness. A second
later the light flashed up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pulled the wrong string,&rdquo; Nina explained as
she lighted both sides of the electric lamp.</p>

<p>Potter paused undecidedly, then rose and, going
over to the packing case, tossed excelsior and paper
back into it and pushed it behind a screen. When
he turned back, he saw Nina deftly rearranging the
ornaments and papers on his flat top desk. In
silence he watched her graceful movements and the
play of the lamplight on her hair which shone like
spun gold under its rays. It would have taken a
more observant man than her husband to have discovered
that nature&rsquo;s art had been supplemented by
the rouge pot. No wrinkles marred the soft pink
and white tint of her complexion, and few would
have guessed that she had passed her thirtieth birthday.</p>

<p>Looking up, Nina caught her husband&rsquo;s gaze and
flushed faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope Mr. Rodgers won&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo; she began,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>and checked herself hastily as Moto ushered in their
caller. &ldquo;So very glad to see you, Mr. Rodgers,&rdquo; she
exclaimed, extending her hand, which rested in his
for a fraction of a second and was withdrawn.</p>

<p>At the touch of her cold fingers, Rodgers looked
intently at her. He still found it hard to realize that
the fashionably gowned woman before him was Ben
Potter&rsquo;s wife. Ben a Benedict! The mere idea had
provoked a smile, and the announcement of the marriage
in cold print had produced a burst of merriment,
and the silent hope that Ben had found a
motherly soul to run his house for him. Instead of
which, with the perversity of Fate, Ben Potter had
selected a wife at least fifteen years his junior, who
would most certainly enjoy the social life of Washington
to the full.</p>

<p>Potter had formed a strong attachment for the
younger man when spending a winter in San Francisco
three years before and Rodgers had been a
frequent visitor since his arrival in Washington.
His visits, as Potter shrewdly noted, were generally
timed to find Kitty Baird with her cousins, and ended
in his escorting her home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I missed you both at Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; tea, so
dropped in for a chat,&rdquo; Rodgers remarked, accepting
a cigar from Potter as Nina perched herself on one
end of the lounge. &ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nina went,&rdquo; answered Potter, throwing himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>down in his favorite chair. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t catch me
at a tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were there, Mrs. Potter?&rdquo; Rodgers spoke
in surprise. &ldquo;I searched for you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a frightful jam.&rdquo; Nina picked up her
workbag which she had left on the lounge earlier
in the afternoon and unfolded its contents. &ldquo;I did
not stay long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you heard the news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;News?&rdquo; Potter glanced up, expectantly. The
tone in which the question was put arrested his attention
which had strayed to his wife. &ldquo;Was there
any special news? Nina, you didn&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard no news in particular.&rdquo; Nina held a
needle and thread nearer the light. &ldquo;To what do
you refer, Mr. Rodgers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the death of Miss Susan Baird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter sat bolt upright. His healthy color changed
to a sickly white. &ldquo;Cousin Susan dead? Impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a fact. Mr. Craige told me&mdash;&rdquo; Rodgers
stooped over and picked up the needle which had
slipped from Nina&rsquo;s clutch. &ldquo;Take care you don&rsquo;t
prick yourself, Mrs. Potter,&rdquo; he warned, as he placed
it in the palm of her hand and noticed the quick,
spasmodic movement of her fingers. &ldquo;The news
had just gotten about and every one at the tea was
talking of Miss Baird.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s turning the tables; usually Cousin Susan
talked about everybody,&rdquo; Potter remarked, breaking
a slight pause. &ldquo;Why hasn&rsquo;t Kitty telephoned us?
I am now her nearest living relative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She may have tried to reach us,&rdquo; suggested his
wife. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose Moto answered the telephone
in my absence; he hates it. Did you hear it ring,
Ben?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; shortly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I grieve over your
news, Ted. I have always resented Cousin Susan&rsquo;s
treatment of Kitty. Made the girl slave for her, the
venomous old scandal-monger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben!&rdquo; Nina&rsquo;s shocked tone caused her husband
to pause in his rapid speech. &ldquo;Did you hear, Mr.
Rodgers, the cause of Cousin Susan&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bit her tongue and died from blood-poisoning,&rdquo;
growled Potter, before Rodgers could answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all right, dear; I&rsquo;ll say no more. But,&rdquo; in
self-defense, noting Rodgers&rsquo; surprise, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had no
cause to love Cousin Susan&mdash; I heard her caustic
remarks about my marriage. Never mind that
now,&rdquo; with a quick glance at his wife. &ldquo;Go ahead,
Ted, tell us of what Cousin Susan died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The coroner will have to answer that question,
Ben.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The coroner!&rdquo; Potter rose to his feet and stared
at his guest. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean? Oh, hurry your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>speech, man; don&rsquo;t keep us in suspense,&rdquo; as Rodgers
hesitated and eyed Mrs. Potter in some trepidation.
Judging from her sudden loss of color, she was
about to faint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your cousin was found dead,&rdquo; he said, and got no
further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Found dead&mdash;where?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Potter,
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In her library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter broke the pause. &ldquo;Go ahead and tell us
what you know, Ted.&rdquo; He reseated himself. &ldquo;Give
us every detail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers shook his head. &ldquo;I know very little on
the subject,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I stopped on the way here
and telephoned to &lsquo;Rose Hill,&rsquo; but could get no response;
so I came right here supposing you could
tell me further news. I thought Miss Kitty might
be with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have not seen Kitty since early this morning,&rdquo;
answered Nina. &ldquo;Who found Cousin Susan?&rdquo;
Rodgers, his ear trained to detect variations in the
human voice, observed a faint huskiness in the usual
soft tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know, Mrs. Potter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Miss
Baird was so well-known in Washington that her
death was commented on at the tea, and I only heard
a garbled account of what occurred. Perhaps there
might be something in the evening paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure.&rdquo; Potter jumped at the suggestion,
and hurrying toward the door, pushed an electric
bell. A second later and Moto responded. &ldquo;The
evening paper, quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moto let his gaze travel around the room, then
darting forward he crossed to where the packing
case stood partially concealed behind the screen.
Delving into its contents, he returned a moment later
with a crumpled newspaper and extended it to his
master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You toss it down, so,&rdquo; demonstrating, &ldquo;when I
bring it to you, sir,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;You say, &lsquo;Moto,
don&rsquo;t trouble me, go away,&rsquo; and I go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Moto, you interrupted me.&rdquo; Potter&rsquo;s
tone was apologetic. &ldquo;Much obliged for finding the
paper. That is all I wanted.&rdquo; And Moto slipped
away to his pantry in time to hear the buzzer of the
front door bell sounding faintly.</p>

<p>Forgetful of all but the paper in his hand, Potter
turned it over and searched for the item of news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try the first page,&rdquo; suggested Rodgers. Potter
switched the sheet around and gave vent to a startled
exclamation as his eyes fell on the double column
heading:</p>

<p class="center no-indent">ELDERLY SPINSTER FOUND DEAD<br />
SUICIDE SUSPECTED</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Suicide!&rdquo; Potter gasped. &ldquo;Bless my soul!
Who would have believed Cousin Susan would kill
herself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; The denial rang out clearly from
the direction of the door and wheeling around the
three occupants of the room saw Kitty Baird confronting
them. &ldquo;Aunt Susan did not commit suicide,
Ben; you know she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter stared at her long and earnestly. Twice
he opened his mouth to speak and closed it again,
after a look at Ted Rodgers who, upon Kitty&rsquo;s entrance,
had stopped somewhat in the background so
that his face was in shadow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything,&rdquo; Potter said finally. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t read the paper&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The paper has printed lies!&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s foot came
down with an unmistakable stamp, and her eyes
sparkled with wrath. &ldquo;I tell you Aunt Susan did not
commit suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo; Nina stepped hastily forward and
threw her arm protectingly across Kitty&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;Come and sit down, and when you are more composed
you can tell us of&mdash;of the details.&rdquo; Exerting
some strength, she pulled the unwilling girl to the
lounge and gently pushed her down upon it. &ldquo;I am
so, so sorry, Kitty. Your aunt&mdash;&rdquo; she stumbled a
bit in her speech&mdash;&ldquo;Your aunt&rsquo;s death is a great
shock&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To me,&rdquo; bitterly. &ldquo;I know many people disliked
her. Poor Aunt Susan&mdash;&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s lips trembled.
&ldquo;You need not try to dissemble your feelings, Ben.
I know you hated Susan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, Kitty; that&rsquo;s pretty strong language!&rdquo;
Potter flushed angrily. &ldquo;You are unstrung&mdash;where
are your smelling salts, Nina?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A glass of wine would be better.&rdquo; Rodgers
spoke for the first time, and Kitty looked up in
startled surprise. She had been conscious of a third
person in the room when she first entered, but, absorbed
in her talk with her cousin, had forgotten his
presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my flask?&rdquo; demanded Potter, considerably
shaken out of his habitual calm. &ldquo;Oh, thank
you, my dear,&rdquo; as Nina snatched it out of one of his
desk drawers. &ldquo;Now, Kitty,&rdquo; unscrewing the stopper
and pouring some cognac into an empty tumbler,
which, with a water carafe, stood on his desk.
&ldquo;Drink this; no, I insist&mdash;&rdquo; as she put up her hand
in protest. &ldquo;You will need all your strength&mdash;drink
every drop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty&rsquo;s eyes sought Rodgers and his quick
&ldquo;Please do&rdquo; did more to make her drink the cognac
than all Potter&rsquo;s urging. The fiery strength of the
old brandy made her catch her breath, but she did
not put the tumbler down until she had swallowed
its contents. As the stimulant crept through her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>veins, her head cleared, and the feeling of deadly
faintness which had threatened to overcome her
several times on her way to her cousin&rsquo;s apartment,
disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you what I know,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;Aunt
Susan was found by the police dead in our library.
The coroner claims that she had taken poison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; prompted Potter. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Susan never swallowed poison&mdash;of her own
free will.&rdquo; Kitty turned and gazed at Ted Rodgers.
Intently she studied his face, noting his clear-cut
features and shapely head. Standing six feet four,
he seemed to dwarf Ben Potter. Although the latter
was nearly his equal in height, the stoop in his
shoulders, which betrayed the hours spent in poring
over books, made Potter appear much shorter.
Something of his quiet, determined character showed
in Rodgers&rsquo; firm mouth and handsome eyes, eyes
which redeemed the severe lines of his face.</p>

<p>He had fallen madly in love with Kitty and had
courted her with the persistency of his faithful nature.
Heartsick, craving sympathy, which had
brought her to her cousin only to be rebuffed by his
reception of the news of her aunt&rsquo;s death, Kitty
turned instinctively to Rodgers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you help me prove that Aunt Susan did
not commit suicide?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>As he studied the upturned face, the deep blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>eyes, made more brilliant by the tears she had shed
that morning, and noted the forlorn droop of her
shoulders, Rodgers&rsquo; decision was taken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do anything for you&mdash;anything,&rdquo; he
promised, his deep voice vibrating with feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then find the murderer of Aunt Susan,&rdquo; she
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;what?&rdquo; Potter looked at her aghast.
&ldquo;What makes <i>you</i> think Cousin Susan was murdered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My intuition,&rdquo; promptly. &ldquo;Oh, you may jeer,
but it was no case of suicide. Aunt Susan did not
court death&mdash;she feared it.&rdquo;</p>

AT THE MORGUE</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smcap">oroner Penfield</span> adjusted his glasses
and gazed at the six men who composed
the jury, as they filed into their places, and
then turned to look at the spectators assembled in
the room reserved for the coroner&rsquo;s inquests at the
District of Columbia Morgue. Not only Washington
society was taking a deep interest in the inquiry
into the death of Miss Susan Baird, but many other
citizens of the national Capital, to whom the name of
Baird meant nothing, and who had been unacquainted
with the spinster in her lifetime. Every
seat was taken in the large square room, and from
his position on the elevated platform, where stood
tables and chairs for the coroner, his assistant, the
reporters, and the witnesses, Coroner Penfield saw
Dr. Leonard McLean conversing with Inspector
Mitchell of the Central Office.</p>

<p>The hands of the wall clock were within five minutes
of ten, the hour at which the inquest had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>called, on Tuesday morning, when the outer door
opened and Ted Rodgers stepped inside the room,
followed a second later by Benjamin Potter. Observing
two unoccupied seats on the second row they
crossed the room, exchanging, as they did so, low-spoken
greetings with friends and acquaintances who
had come early to secure the most advantageous
seats.</p>

<p>The swearing in of the jury by the Morgue Master
required but a short time. Clearing his throat,
Coroner Penfield outlined the reason for the inquest,
and asked the jury if they had inspected the body of
the dead woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have,&rdquo; responded the foreman, and Penfield
turned to the Morgue Master, who occupied a chair
at the foot of the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call the first witness,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;Inspector
Mitchell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hat in hand, the Inspector advanced to the steps
and mounted to the witness chair, and was duly
sworn by the Morgue Master. In businesslike tones
he answered the coroner&rsquo;s quickly put questions as
to his identity and length of service on the Metropolitan
Police Force and Detective Bureau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find Miss Baird&rsquo;s body?&rdquo; asked the
coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday, Monday morning, when summoned
to her home in Georgetown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did the summons reach you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By telephone.&rdquo; Mitchell hesitated, and the coroner
waited for him to continue before putting another
question. &ldquo;The message was to go at once to
&lsquo;Rose Hill,&rsquo; that a crime had been committed there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the person talking on the telephone give his
name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ask his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, but she rang off instead of answering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She?&rdquo; inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took the voice to be that of a woman,&rdquo; explained
Mitchell cautiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not certain that it was a woman speaking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the best of my belief it was.&rdquo; Mitchell
paused. &ldquo;I am sure it was a woman&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you tried to trace the call?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; somewhat glumly. &ldquo;But Central had no
record of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it did not come over a public telephone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it on a limited service wire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Central declares not,&rdquo; responded Mitchell.
&ldquo;She insists that it must have been sent by some one
using unlimited service.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Penfield paused to jot down a note on his memorandum
pad before again questioning the inspector.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what hour did the telephone call reach you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At eight minutes past eight o&rsquo;clock yesterday
morning. I was in Police Headquarters and took
the message myself,&rdquo; tersely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what hour did you reach Miss Baird&rsquo;s home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifteen minutes later. I took O&rsquo;Bryan, a plain
clothes man, and Patrolman Myers with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us what you found when you reached the
Baird house,&rdquo; Coroner Penfield directed, settling
back in his chair. Conscious that he had the undivided
attention of every one in the crowded room,
Mitchell spoke with slow impressiveness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We went up the front steps of the house and
rang the bell; not getting any response we rang
several times. I was just thinking that we had better
try the back entrance when O&rsquo;Bryan saw the key
in the front door&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; Penfield held up his hand. &ldquo;Do I understand
that the key to the front door was left in
the lock on the <i>outside</i> in plain view of every passer-by?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t exactly in plain view,&rdquo; protested Mitchell.
&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see it at once, and the sidewalk is
some distance from the house, which stands on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>high terrace. Passers-by could not see the key in
the lock unless they ran up the steps and stood in
the vestibule of the front door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was the door locked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it a spring lock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir.&rdquo; Mitchell drew an old-fashioned brass
key from his pocket and handed it to the coroner.
&ldquo;That lock, Sir, was made by hand many years ago.
It&rsquo;s the kind that if you lock the door, either from
the inside or the outside, the door could not be
opened unless you had the key to unlock it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Inspector, some person, on leaving the
Baird house, locked the door on the outside, and
thereby locked in any person or persons who might
have been in the house at that time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ump!&rdquo; Penfield picked up the brass key and
handed it to the foreman of the jury. &ldquo;Did you
find finger marks on the key?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not one.&rdquo; Mitchell hesitated. &ldquo;Whoever
handled the key wore gloves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo; Penfield spoke more briskly.
&ldquo;What did you discover inside the house, Inspector?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We found no one in the hall; so we walked into
the parlor which is on the right of the front door.
No one was there, so we kept on through the door
opening into the rear hall, and from there walked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>into the library.&rdquo; Mitchell paused dramatically.
&ldquo;There we found Miss Baird&rsquo;s dead body lying
huddled up in a big chair in front of her tea table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had she been taking tea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, judging from the plate of sandwiches and
cakes, and her nearly empty teacup.&rdquo; Mitchell explained
in detail. &ldquo;There was a plate in front of her
on which lay a half-eaten peach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there evidence to show that some one had
been having tea with Miss Baird?&rdquo; inquired Penfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one cup and saucer and plate had been
used, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the chairs, how were they placed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About as usual, I imagine.&rdquo; Mitchell looked a
trifle worried. &ldquo;There was no chair drawn up to
the tea table, if you mean that. Only Miss Baird&rsquo;s
chair stood close by it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do upon the discovery of Miss
Baird&rsquo;s body?&rdquo; asked Penfield, after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Made sure that she was dead and not in need of
a physician, then sent O&rsquo;Bryan to telephone to the
coroner, while Myers and I searched the house,&rdquo; replied
Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find any one in the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir. It was empty, except for the dead
woman and a cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The inspector&rsquo;s reply caused a stir of interest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>and one juror started to address him, then, conscious
of attracting attention, decided not to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find the windows and doors locked?&rdquo;
inquired Penfield, after a second&rsquo;s thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that is, those on the first floor and in the
basement were locked,&rdquo; explained Mitchell. &ldquo;The
windows on the second and third floors were unlocked,
but closed. Sunday was a cold day,&rdquo; he
added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In your opinion, Mitchell, could the house have
been entered from the second story?&rdquo; asked Penfield.</p>

<p>The inspector considered the question before answering.
&ldquo;No, Sir, not without a ladder, and we
found none on the premises. The house sets back
in its own grounds, so to speak, and the neighboring
houses are quite far away. There is no party wall,
and no porch roof to aid a housebreaker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all for the present, Inspector. As you
go out, ask O&rsquo;Bryan to come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plain clothes officer kept them waiting only
a brief second. His testimony simply corroborated
that of his superior officer, and Patrolman Myers,
who followed him, added nothing of interest. Upon
his departure from the platform, his place was taken
by an old negro, who, with some difficulty, mounted
the steps and hobbled across the platform to the
witness chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked Coroner Penfield,
who had waited in some impatience while the witness
was being sworn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oscar, Sah, please, Sah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oscar what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oscar Benjamin De Cassenove Jackson, Sah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Oscar, are you acquainted with the nature
of an oath?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laws, Sah, ain&rsquo;t I been married mos&rsquo; forty
years? My wife, she&rsquo;s kinda handy wif her tongue,&rdquo;
and Oscar smiled, deprecatingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not alluding to swearing,&rdquo; exclaimed Penfield.
&ldquo;I mean the sort of oath requiring you to tell
the truth and nothing but the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laws, Sah, I tells de truf every day o&rsquo; my life,&rdquo;
replied Oscar with some indignation. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no
occasion to tell me that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Penfield spoke with sternness. &ldquo;Remember,
you are under oath to tell only the truth.
When did you last see Miss Susan Baird alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oscar blinked at the abruptness of the question.
&ldquo;Sunday mawning, Sah, when I was servin&rsquo; dinner
at one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she appear to be in good spirits?&rdquo; asked
Penfield. &ldquo;In good health&mdash;&rdquo; he added, noting
Oscar&rsquo;s mystified expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yessir. She ate real hearty, and when I went
in de lib&rsquo;ry after dinner, she was jes&rsquo; as peaceful an&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>ca&rsquo;m, a-sittin&rsquo; in that great easy chair o&rsquo; hers as if
she never had had no words with Miss Kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so Miss Baird had words with Miss Kitty&mdash;and
who might Miss Kitty be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A startled look flitted across Ted Rodgers&rsquo; face,
to be gone the next instant. He had followed the
testimony of each witness with undivided attention,
answering only in monosyllables the muttered remarks
made to him occasionally by Ben Potter,
whose expression of boredom had given place to
more lively interest at sight of Oscar on his way
to the witness chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who am Miss Kitty?&rdquo; asked Oscar in scandalized
surprise. &ldquo;Why, Miss Baird&rsquo;s niece. They
live together, leastwise they did &rsquo;till yesterday. Poor
ole Miss, she didn&rsquo;t mean no harm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No harm to whom?&rdquo; questioned Penfield swiftly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Miss Kitty. She jes&rsquo; said she wouldn&rsquo;t have
no such carrying-on,&rdquo; explained Oscar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To what did she refer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oscar favored the coroner with a blank stare. &ldquo;I
dunno, Sah. That&rsquo;s all o&rsquo; de conversation that I
overheard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Penfield regarded him attentively, but the old
man&rsquo;s gaze did not waver, and after a moment he
resumed his examination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you worked for Miss Baird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Most twenty years, Sah.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did you do for her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cooked, waited on de table, tended de fires and
de garden, cleaned de house, an&rsquo; run errands,&rdquo;
ended Oscar with a flourish, and Penfield had difficulty
in suppressing a smile. Oscar&rsquo;s rheumatic
legs did not suggest an agile errand boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who were the other servants?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t none,&rdquo; tersely. &ldquo;Miss Baird, she
wouldn&rsquo;t keep no yeller help, so Mandy, my wife,
washed de clothes, an&rsquo; I done de rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you and Mandy sleep in Miss Baird&rsquo;s
house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sah. We lives in our own house, two blocks
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were your working hours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; Oscar stroked his wooly head reflectively.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Most all day,&rdquo; he volunteered finally.
&ldquo;Mandy had one o&rsquo; her spells yesterday mawnin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
I had ter get a doctah fo&rsquo; her, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s why I never
reached Miss Baird&rsquo;s &rsquo;til &rsquo;bout noon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Penfield sat back in his chair and fumbled
with his watch charm. Oscar as a witness was
a disappointment, whatever his accomplishments as
an all-round servant. &ldquo;At what hour did you leave
Miss Baird&rsquo;s on Sunday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout half-past two,&rdquo; answered Oscar, after due
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And whom did you leave in the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Baird and her niece, Miss Kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one else&mdash;no visitor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think again, Oscar. Remember, you are under
oath. Did either Miss Baird or Miss Kitty Baird
have callers before you left on Sunday afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sah, they did not, not while I was there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Penfield pushed back his chair and rose. &ldquo;That
will do, Oscar, you are excused. Hume,&rdquo; to the
Morgue Master. &ldquo;Call Miss Katrina Baird.&rdquo;</p>

TESTIMONY</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">here</span> was craning of necks and bending
of heads as the Morgue Master opened the
door leading to the room where the witnesses
waited to be called, and every eye was focussed
on Kitty Baird as she stepped into the court
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so startled, Kitty,&rdquo; whispered Dr.
Leonard McLean in her ear. He had retained his
seat by the door, expecting to leave at any moment.
&ldquo;This inquest is only a legal formality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But these people&mdash;the publicity,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Move on, Miss, move on,&rdquo; directed Hume, the
Morgue Master. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t talk to the witnesses,
Doctor. This way, Miss,&rdquo; and interposing his thickset,
stocky figure between Leonard and Kitty, he
followed her to the platform and administered the
oath: &ldquo;To tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty sat down in the witness chair with a feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>of thankfulness. The space between it and the door
through which she had entered had seemed an endless
distance as she traversed it. Coroner Penfield
swung his chair around so as to obtain a better view
of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your full name?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katrina Baird.&rdquo; Her low voice barely reached
the jurors, and Penfield smiled at her encouragingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please speak louder,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Were you
related to Miss Susan Baird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; she was my aunt,&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s voice gained in
strength as her confidence returned. &ldquo;My father,
Judge George Baird, was her only brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You made your home in Georgetown with your
aunt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ever since the death of my parents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who else resided with your aunt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No servants?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Our only servant, Oscar, never slept in the
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did your aunt ever employ another servant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No chambermaid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s flush was becoming to her, the
coroner decided. The added color brought out the
blue of her eyes and softened the haggard lines
which had come overnight. &ldquo;My aunt could not af<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>ford
to employ two servants, so we looked after the
house, Oscar doing the heavy work. He was always
faithful and kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And devoted to your aunt?&rdquo; with a quick look
at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; she responded, calmly.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause before Penfield again
addressed her, and Kitty, her first nervous dread of
facing the crowded court room a thing of the past,
allowed her gaze to wander about the room. It was
with a sharp stab of pain that she recognized more
than one familiar face among the spectators. Could
it be that men and women whom her aunt had
counted among her friends and whom she had entertained
in her limited way had come to the inquest
from curiosity? Kitty shivered, the idea shocked
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you spend last Sunday at home, Miss
Baird?&rdquo; asked Penfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not the entire day,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I left there
about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon to go to my
cousin, Mrs. Benjamin Potter, at whose apartment
I was to spend the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it your custom to leave your aunt alone in
the house at night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a custom, certainly; but I did occasionally
stay overnight with friends or with my cousins, Mr.
and Mrs. Potter, in Washington,&rdquo; Kitty explained.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>&ldquo;Aunt Susan was never afraid of being left alone
in the house. And, of course, I was at my work all
through the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is your work, Miss Baird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am employed as a social secretary by Mrs. Amos
Parsons,&rdquo; she replied, concisely. &ldquo;I am with her
from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only on week days?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have Sunday to myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how did you spend last Sunday, Miss
Baird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to church in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Major Leigh Wallace accompanied me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Major Wallace return to your house with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The curtly spoken monosyllable brought a sharp
glance from the coroner, of which she appeared unaware.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what hour did you reach your house, Miss
Baird?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After church&mdash;&rdquo; she considered a moment. &ldquo;To
be exact, about a quarter of one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you and your aunt lunch alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. We had no guests,&rdquo; briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did you do after luncheon?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t luncheon, it was dinner,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;I went upstairs almost immediately after
it was served, and changed my dress preparatory to
going out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you last see your aunt alive?&rdquo; asked
Penfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I was leaving the house,&rdquo; Kitty spoke more
hurriedly, &ldquo;I looked into her bedroom and called out
&lsquo;Good-by!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Baird,&rdquo; Penfield let his eyeglasses dangle
from their ribbon and stood up. &ldquo;Was your aunt
expecting guests at tea on Sunday afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure she was not,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Aunt
Susan always asked me to arrange the tea table if
she had invited any of her friends to come and see
her. She was, eh, formal and insisted that her
guests be given tea when they called.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it your aunt&rsquo;s custom to drink tea every
afternoon whether she had guests or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. She had a spirit lamp and a tea caddy
in the library, and made tea for herself,&rdquo; Kitty responded.
&ldquo;But if any friends were coming she insisted
always that the table be especially arranged&mdash;sandwiches&mdash;and
all that,&rdquo; a trifle vaguely. Kitty
was growing tired of answering questions which appeared
to lead nowhere.</p>

<p>Coroner Penfield picked up several sheets of pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>per
and thumbed them over until he came to a penciled
memorandum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were two sandwiches and some peaches
on the tea table in front of your aunt,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;Who prepared those sandwiches?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the second time Kitty colored hotly. &ldquo;The
sandwiches were left over from some I made on
Saturday when Aunt Susan entertained Mrs. Amos
Parsons at tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the peaches&mdash;&rdquo; questioned Penfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where Aunt Susan got the
peaches,&rdquo; she said, with a quick shrug of her shoulders.
&ldquo;Probably Oscar brought them to her on
Sunday morning when I was out. He knew her fondness
for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you not always know what supplies you had
in your larder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no.&rdquo; With a lift of her eyebrows. &ldquo;Oscar
did the marketing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Penfield laid down the papers in his hand. &ldquo;Was
your aunt in her normal health on Sunday?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apparently so; I never observed any change in
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had she complained of illness recently?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. On the contrary, she seemed brighter and
more cheerful during the past ten days,&rdquo; Kitty answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Was she ever despondent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; promptly. &ldquo;She always looked on the
bright side of things. I&mdash;&rdquo; with a fleeting smile&mdash;&ldquo;I
was the pessimist of the family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Coroner Penfield regarded her thoughtfully.
She looked barely out of her &lsquo;teens,&rsquo; and hers
was certainly not the face of a pessimist&mdash;youth,
good health, and good looks did not conspire to a
gloomy outlook on life. &ldquo;Who were your aunt&rsquo;s
intimate friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean women of her own age?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; of her age, and also of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty debated the question thoughtfully before
answering it. &ldquo;Not many of Aunt Susan&rsquo;s old
friends are alive,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Aunty had just passed
her seventieth birthday. She liked all my friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>All?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Kitty regarded him steadfastly. She had
noted the emphasis on the word &ldquo;all.&rdquo; A moment
passed before the coroner addressed her again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Baird, have you unlimited telephone service?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s tone expressed surprise.
&ldquo;We have always had unlimited service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Penfield paused and wrote a few lines on his memorandum
pad. When he spoke, his voice had gained
an added seriousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you and your aunt always on the best of
terms?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Kitty sat erect and her hands dropped on the arms
of her chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your question is impertinent,&rdquo; she said cuttingly,
and, in spite of himself, Penfield flushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I insist upon an answer,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;A truthful
answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Penfield!&rdquo; Kitty rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be seated, Madam. A witness cannot leave until
dismissed by the coroner.&rdquo; Penfield spoke with
unwonted severity. &ldquo;I will change my question.
What did you and Miss Baird quarrel about on
Sunday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quarrel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madam, quarrel. Your servant, Oscar,
overheard you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty&rsquo;s bright color had flown. With eyes expressing
her scorn, she threw back her head defiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask Oscar,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Servants&rsquo; gossip
may prove diverting&mdash;whether truthful or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Penfield watched her for an intolerable moment.
Kitty&rsquo;s breath was coming unevenly when he finally
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are excused, Miss Baird,&rdquo; he stated briefly,
and turned to the Morgue Master. &ldquo;Summon Mrs.
Benjamin Potter, Hume,&rdquo; he directed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Kitty&rsquo;s sudden dismissal by the coroner was a
shock to the reporters as well as to the spectators,
and they watched her leave the room with undisguised
curiosity and disappointment. Were they
to be cheated out of a sensational scene? Why had
not Coroner Penfield pressed home his question?</p>

<p>Nina Potter&rsquo;s entrance cut short speculation and
the reporters watched her take her place in the witness
chair with renewed hope. Her self-possessed
air was a surprise to Ted Rodgers, who secretly considered
her a bundle of nerves. She looked extremely
pretty and Coroner Penfield watched her
admiringly as the oath was being administered.
From his seat on the second row, Ben Potter leaned
against Rodgers, regardless of the latter&rsquo;s discomfort,
in his endeavor to get an uninterrupted view
of his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Potter,&rdquo; Coroner Penfield had again resumed
his seat. &ldquo;What relation are you to Miss
Katrina Baird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No relation, except by marriage.&rdquo; Her voice,
though low, held a carrying quality, and reached the
ears of all in the room. &ldquo;My husband is her second
cousin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you known her long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since my marriage to her cousin, six months
ago,&rdquo; briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know her aunt, Miss Susan Baird?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, very well. We frequently took Sunday
dinner with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear Miss Susan Baird express a
dislike for any particular person?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nina shook her head, while a faint smile drew
down the corners of her pretty mouth. &ldquo;Miss Susan
disliked a great many people,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Me, among
them. In fact, I never heard her make a complimentary
remark about any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Penfield looked taken aback. &ldquo;Miss Baird was eccentric,
was she not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, not to say odd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nina raised her eyebrows and pursed up her
mouth before answering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Miss Baird was calling upon friends and
liked the tea cakes, she would open her bag and pour
the cakes into it,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;If she was shopping
downtown and grew weary, she would look
about and if she saw a motor car belonging to any
of her friends waiting at the curb, she would inform
the chauffeur he was to take her home.
And&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Potter&rsquo;s smile was most engaging,
&ldquo;Miss Baird always got her own way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until her death&mdash;&rdquo; dryly. &ldquo;It looked as if some
one balked her there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and who was that some one?&rdquo; questioned
Mrs. Potter sweetly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Coroner Penfield concealed his annoyance under
a pretense of hunting for a pencil among the papers
on his table. While listening intently to the dialogue
between Penfield and Mrs. Potter, Ted Rodgers had
grown aware that Ben Potter was gnawing his nails.
Rodgers loathed small noises. He was about to remonstrate
when Potter leaned back and whispered in his
ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always told you Nina was clever; bless her
heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers attempted no reply as he waited for
Coroner Penfield&rsquo;s next question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Miss Kitty Baird spend Sunday night at
your apartment, Mrs. Potter?&rdquo; asked Penfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did,&rdquo; with quiet emphasis. &ldquo;She came
in time to help me serve tea in my husband&rsquo;s studio,
stayed to dinner, and retired early. We had breakfast
at nine o&rsquo;clock, after which she returned to
Georgetown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all, Mrs. Potter, thank you,&rdquo; and Penfield
assisted her down the steps, then turned aside
to speak to Hume. &ldquo;Recall Oscar Jackson,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Potter had almost reached the door when it
opened to admit Major Leigh Wallace. He failed
to see her in his hurry to secure a seat vacated by
an elderly woman who was just leaving and brushed
by without greeting. Nina&rsquo;s pretty color had van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>ished
when she reached her motor parked near the
Morgue. She did not start the engine, however,
upon entering the car but sat waiting with untiring
patience for the inquest to adjourn.</p>

<p>Nina&rsquo;s exit from the court room had been closely
watched by two pairs of eyes. When Rodgers turned
to speak to Potter, he found him sitting well back
in his chair, and his whole attention centered on
Major Leigh Wallace. The latter, entirely oblivious
of the identity of the men and women about him,
sat regarding the coroner and the jury while his
restless fingers rolled a swagger stick held upright
between the palms of his hands.</p>

<p>Coroner Penfield hardly allowed the old negro
servant time to take his seat again in the witness
chair, before addressing him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were Miss Baird and her niece, Miss Kitty,
quarreling about on Sunday?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-w-what yo&rsquo; ax?&rdquo; Oscar&rsquo;s breath, such as he
had left after his exertions in reaching the platform,
deserted him, and he stared in dumb surprise at the
coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have testified that you overheard Miss Baird
and her niece quarreling,&rdquo; Penfield spoke slowly and
with emphasis. &ldquo;What were they quarreling about?
Come,&rdquo; as the old man remained silent. &ldquo;We are
awaiting your answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yessir.&rdquo; Oscar ducked his head, and the whites
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>of his eyes showed plainly as he rolled them in
fright, first toward the jury and then toward the
coroner. &ldquo;Yessir, &rsquo;twarn&rsquo;t much of a fuss; leastways,
it might o&rsquo; been wuss, but Miss Kitty, she
done jes&rsquo; walk upstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it about?&rdquo; insisted Penfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well &rsquo;er,&rdquo; Oscar fingered his worn cap nervously.
&ldquo;Miss Susan, she didn&rsquo;t think much of some
of Miss Kitty&rsquo;s beaux&mdash;jes&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t want her to get
married nohow&mdash;&rsquo;specially that there Major Wallace.
An&rsquo; she ups an&rsquo; tells Miss Kitty she mus&rsquo; get rid o&rsquo;
him, or she would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would what&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Git rid o&rsquo; him,&rdquo; explained Oscar. &ldquo;Miss Susan
jes&rsquo; despised him, even if he did lay himself out to
please her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was Major Wallace there on Sunday?&rdquo; inquired
the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sah.&rdquo; With vigorous emphasis. &ldquo;The
Major ain&rsquo;t been there for mos&rsquo; two weeks. Miss
Susan and him had words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed. When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout two weeks ago, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps longer. Major
Wallace kep&rsquo; callin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; Miss Susan up an&rsquo; tole him
Miss Kitty couldn&rsquo;t be bothered with his company.&rdquo;
Oscar came to a breathless pause. He had caught
sight of a man leaving his seat and recognized
Major Leigh Wallace. The next second the door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>had opened and closed behind Wallace&rsquo;s retreating
figure.</p>

<p>Penfield&rsquo;s stern voice recalled Oscar&rsquo;s wandering
wits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you do the marketing on Saturday, Oscar?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sah.&rdquo; Oscar spoke more cheerfully at the
change of the topic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you buy some peaches for Miss Baird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deed, I didn&rsquo;t, Sah. Miss Susan hadn&rsquo;t no
money to buy peaches at dis time o&rsquo; year,&rdquo; Oscar&rsquo;s
voice expressed astonishment. &ldquo;Dis hyar month
am March.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have them from California.&rdquo; Penfield was
growing impatient, and his manner stiffened as he
faced the old negro. &ldquo;Who purchased the peaches
which Miss Baird was eating just before she died?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno, Sah; honest to God, I dunno.&rdquo; Oscar
shook a puzzled head. &ldquo;I was flabbergasted to see
them peaches on the tea table. They weren&rsquo;t in the
house when I was gettin&rsquo; dinner, an&rsquo; they weren&rsquo;t
there when I left after servin&rsquo; dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Penfield stared at Oscar. The
black face of the negro was as shiny as a billiard
ball and about as expressionless. &ldquo;That is all, Oscar,
you may retire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly waiting for the servant to descend the
steps, Penfield turned to the deputy coroner whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>busy pen had been transcribing the notes of the inquest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Fisher, take the stand,&rdquo; he directed, and
waited in silence while he was being sworn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You performed the autopsy, Doctor?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, Sir, in the presence of the Morgue Master
and Dr. Leonard McLean,&rdquo; responded the deputy
coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;State the results of the autopsy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We found on investigation of the gastric contents
that death was due to prussic acid, the most
active of poisons,&rdquo; Fisher replied, with blunt directness.
&ldquo;There was no other cause of death, as from
the condition of her body, we found Miss Baird, in
spite of her age, did not suffer from any organic disease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The silence lengthened in the court room. Penfield
did not seem in haste to put the next question
and the suspense deepened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you estimate how long a time must have
elapsed between Miss Baird taking the poison and
her death?&rdquo; he asked finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between two and five minutes, judging from the
amount of poison in her system,&rdquo; responded Fisher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell us how the poison was administered,
Doctor?&rdquo; questioned Penfield. &ldquo;Did you analyze
the contents of the tea pot and cup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. No trace of poison was in either the cup
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>or the teapot.&rdquo; Fisher spoke with deliberation,
conscious that his words were listened to with breathless
interest. &ldquo;There was on her plate a half-eaten
peach on which still remained enough poison to kill
several persons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Penfield broke the tense pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea, Doctor, how the poison got
on the peach?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On examination we found that drops of prussic
acid still remained on the fruit knife used to cut the
peach.&rdquo; Fisher hesitated a brief instant, then continued,
&ldquo;The poison had been put on one side of the
knife-blade only.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That whoever ate the other portion of the peach
was not poisoned.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">rs. Amos Parsons</span> laid down her
evening newspaper and stared at her own
reflection in the upright, silver-framed
mirror standing on the table by her side. So absorbing
were her thoughts that she did not observe
a velvet-footed servant remove the tea tray and carry
off the soiled cups and saucers. The French clock
on the high mantel of the drawing room had ticked
away fully ten minutes before she stirred. With an
indolent gesture of her hands, eminently characteristic,
she dropped them in her lap and let her body
relax against the tufted chair back. Her mirror
told her that she needed rest; the deep shadows under
her eyes and her unusual pallor both emphasized
the same story. She was very, very weary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, Madam.&rdquo; The velvet-footed butler
was back in the room again, silver salver in hand.
&ldquo;A gentleman to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons picked up the small visiting card
and adjusting her lorgnette, inspected the engraved
lettering it bore.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">MR. BENJAMIN POTTER<br /><br />
Cosmos Club</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Potter?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the reception room downstairs, madam. He
said he was in a great hurry, Madam,&rdquo; as she remained
silent. &ldquo;He asked particularly to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; show him up. Wait&mdash;&rdquo; as the
servant started for the doorway. &ldquo;Bring Mr. Potter
upstairs in the lift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, Madam,&rdquo; and, a second later, Mrs.
Parsons was alone in her drawing room.</p>

<p>Leaning forward, she looked about the beautifully
furnished room, then, convinced that she was
its only occupant, she opened her vanity case and
selecting a lip-stick, applied it, and added a touch of
rouge. Lastly a powder-puff removed all outward
traces of restless hours and weary waiting. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>had just time to slip the puff and lip-stick inside her
vanity box before the portières parted and Ben
Potter hastened into the room. He stopped his
rapid stride on catching sight of her and advanced
more leisurely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Cecilia,&rdquo; he said, and paused in
front of her.</p>

<p>She appeared not to see his half-extended hand,
as she laid down her cigarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Ben,&rdquo; she remarked dryly. &ldquo;I see that you
still believe in the efficacy of a bribe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is big enough,&rdquo; composedly. &ldquo;Your servant
said you had denied yourself to callers so&mdash;<i>voilà
tout</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why this desire to see me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter did not reply at once; instead, he scrutinized
her intently. She was well worth a second
glance. Her type of face belonged to the Eighteenth
Century, and as she sat in her high-backed chair,
her prematurely grey hair, artistically arranged, in
pretty contrast to her delicately arched eyebrows,
she resembled a French marquise of the court of
Louis XIV. She bore Potter&rsquo;s penetrating gaze
with undisturbed composure. He was the first to
shift his glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose I take a chair and we talk things over,&rdquo;
he suggested. &ldquo;You are not very cordial-to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons smiled ironically. &ldquo;Take a chair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>by all means; that one by the door looks substantial.
Now,&rdquo; as he dragged it over and placed it directly
in front of her. &ldquo;I will repeat my question&mdash;why
do you wish to see me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ask that&mdash;and a newspaper by your side!&rdquo;
Potter pointed contemptuously at the paper lying on
the floor. &ldquo;Have you seen Kitty Baird since the
inquest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons shook her head. &ldquo;There was hardly
time for her to get here; besides she must be very
weary, not to say&mdash;unstrung.&rdquo; She held out her
cigarette case, but Potter waved it away, making no
effort politely to restrain his impatience. &ldquo;So dear
Miss Susan Baird was poisoned after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why &lsquo;after all&rsquo;?&rdquo; swiftly. &ldquo;Why &lsquo;<i>dear</i> Miss
Susan&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shrug of her shapely shoulders answered him.
&ldquo;You are always so intense, Ben,&rdquo; she remarked.
&ldquo;Why <i>not</i> &lsquo;dear Miss Susan&rsquo;? Had you any reason
to dislike your cousin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had any one any reason to like her?&rdquo; he asked
gruffly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be told that.&rdquo; His
smile had little mirth in it. &ldquo;The poor soul is dead&mdash;murdered.&rdquo;
He looked at her queerly. &ldquo;How much
does Kitty see of Major Leigh Wallace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons selected another cigarette with care.
&ldquo;So that is the reason I am honored by a visit from
you.&rdquo; Tossing back her head, she inspected him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>from head to foot. &ldquo;How am I qualified to answer
your question? I am not Kitty&rsquo;s guardian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but you are her employer,&rdquo; with quiet emphasis.
&ldquo;And Major Wallace is a frequent caller
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he?&rdquo; Her smile was enigmatical. &ldquo;May I ask
the reason of your sudden interest in Major Wallace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter colored hotly. &ldquo;That is my affair,&rdquo; he
retorted. &ldquo;Were you at the Baird inquest this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you read the newspaper account of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is your opinion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;I have formed none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; Potter smiled skeptically, then
frowned. &ldquo;Kitty must be safeguarded,&rdquo; he announced
with gruff abruptness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Major Wallace?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She considered him a moment in silence. Potter&rsquo;s
big frame did not show to best advantage in his
sack suit which betrayed the need of sponging and
pressing. The naturalist seldom gave a thought to
his personal appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is your wife?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Potter started a trifle at the abrupt question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite well,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But a bit fagged after
the inquest. She was one of the witnesses, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not called by the coroner,&rdquo; shortly. &ldquo;Ted
Rodgers and I sat together in the court room. He&rsquo;s
a good chap, Ted&mdash;promised Kitty to help trace her
aunt&rsquo;s murderer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pupils of Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; eyes contracted. &ldquo;I
did not realize that they were on such terms of intimacy,&rdquo;
she remarked, and her voice had grown
sharper. &ldquo;Do you think Mr. Rodgers will have a
difficult task?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter ran his fingers through his untidy grey
hair. &ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;So
far, all that we know is that my cousin, Miss Susan
Baird, was poisoned with prussic acid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all the police know?&rdquo; she questioned rapidly.</p>

<p>He did not answer immediately, his attention
apparently centered on the newspaper which lay
folded so that the headlines were in view:</p>

<p class="center no-indent">Coroner&rsquo;s Inquest Returns Open Verdict</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all that the police will admit knowing,&rdquo; he
said at last. &ldquo;I must remind you that you have not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>answered my question: how often does Kitty see
Major Wallace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am unable to tell you.&rdquo; There was a touch of
insolence in her manner and his eyes sparkled with
anger. &ldquo;I do not keep tab on Kitty&mdash;&rdquo; their glances
crossed&mdash;&ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t intend to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter hesitated a second, then rose. &ldquo;It was
good of you to see me,&rdquo; he announced. His tone
was perfunctory. &ldquo;My interest in Kitty prompted
the visit.&rdquo; He stooped over and picked up a glove
which had slipped from his restless fingers to the
floor. &ldquo;Good-by. Don&rsquo;t trouble to ring for James;
I know my way out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Parsons was already half across the
room and her finger touched the electric button with
some force. James was a trifle out of breath when
he reached them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take Mr. Potter down in the lift,&rdquo; she directed.
&ldquo;Good evening, Ben,&rdquo; and with a slight, graceful
gesture, she dismissed him.</p>

<p>Once more back in her chair Mrs. Parsons settled
down in comfort and permitted her thoughts to
wander far afield. It was not often that she allowed
herself to dwell on the past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Ted Rodgers is taking a hand in the game,&rdquo;
she murmured, unconscious that she spoke aloud.
&ldquo;And Ben Potter is interested in&mdash;Kitty.&rdquo; Putting
back her head, she laughed heartily. She was still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>chuckling to herself when James, the butler, came
in to announce dinner.</p>

<p>Dinner with Mrs. Parsons was a formal affair
even when alone, and she looked with approval at
the spotless linen, the burnished silver, and glittering
glass. She thoroughly appreciated her butler&rsquo;s taste
in table decoration. Domestic troubles, which vexed
other women, never touched her household. She
had one theory which she always put into practice&mdash;to
pay her servants just a little more than her
neighbors gave their domestics, and it was seldom
that they left her employ.</p>

<p>Washington society had found that Mrs. Parsons
was wealthy enough to indulge in her whims, and,
bringing, as she did, letters of introduction from
far-off California to influential residents of the national
Capital, she had been entertained at houses
to which newcomers frequently waited for years to
gain the <i>entrée</i>. Well gowned, handsome rather
than pretty, quick of wit, Mrs. Parsons soon attained
a place for herself in the kaleidoscopic life
of the cosmopolitan city, and, giving up her suite of
rooms at the New Willard had, three months before,
purchased a house on fashionable Wyoming Avenue.</p>

<p>On taking possession of what she termed her
<i>maisonnette</i>, Mrs. Parsons decided that she had need
of a social secretary. Kitty Baird had been highly
recommended for the post by Charles Craige, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>after much urging on the part of both Mrs. Parsons
and her godfather, Kitty had resigned her clerkship
in the Department of State, which she had held
during the World War, and taken up her secretarial
duties.</p>

<p>And Kitty had been of genuine aid to her employer,
as Mrs. Parsons acknowledged to herself if
to no one else&mdash;she was chary of spoken praise.
Kitty had not only an accurate knowledge of social
life in Washington, having enjoyed belleship since
her first &ldquo;tea dance&rdquo; at Rauscher&rsquo;s which one of her
aunt&rsquo;s old friends had given in her honor, but possessed
unbounded tact and a kindly heart. Her aunt,
Miss Susan Baird, had seen to it that she was well
educated and thoroughly grounded in French and
German. Having a natural gift for languages, Kitty
had put her early training to good account in her
war work as a translator and code expert.</p>

<p>To James&rsquo; secret distress, Mrs. Parsons partook
but indifferently of the deliciously cooked dinner,
even refusing dessert which, to his mind, was inexplicable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Miss Kitty Baird telephoned at any time
to-day?&rdquo; she asked, laying down her napkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Madam.&rdquo; James concealed his surprise.
It was not like Mrs. Parsons to repeat herself, and to
his best recollection, and he had a good memory, she
had asked that same question at least a dozen times.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>&ldquo;Will you have coffee served in the drawing room,
Madam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for coffee to-night, thanks.&rdquo; Mrs.
Parsons picked up her scarf and rose. &ldquo;Tell Anton
that if any one calls this evening, I am at
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, Madam,&rdquo; and James held back the
portières for her as she left the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons did not return to the drawing room:
instead she made her way to the &ldquo;den&rdquo; at the end of
the hall, a pretty square room, which served as a
lounge and library. Once there she paused by the
telephone stand and laid her hand on the instrument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;West, 789.&rdquo; She was forced to repeat the number
several times before Central got it correctly.</p>

<p>There was a brief wait, then came the answer,
&ldquo;Line disconnected, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; and she heard Central
ring off. Mrs. Parsons put down the instrument
in bewildered surprise. &ldquo;Why had Kitty Baird&rsquo;s
telephone been disconnected?&rdquo; She was still considering
the puzzle as she rearranged some &ldquo;bridesmaids&rsquo;
roses&rdquo; in a vase. By it lay a note in Charles
Craige&rsquo;s fine penmanship. Picking up the note, Mrs.
Parsons read it for perhaps the twentieth time.</p>

<p>It ran:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My precious Cecelia:</p>

<p>I am disconsolate that I cannot dine with you to-night.
I have promised to see Kitty&mdash;poor girl, she
needs all the sympathy and help we can give her.
Miss me just a little and I shall be contented. My
thoughts are with you always.</p>

<p class="right2">Ever faithfully,</p>

<p class="right">Charles Craige.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, Madam.&rdquo; James the obsequious
stood in the room, card tray in hand. &ldquo;Major Leigh
Wallace is waiting for you in the drawing room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons folded the note and slipped it inside
her knitting bag. &ldquo;Ask Major Wallace to
come here,&rdquo; she said, pausing to switch on a floor
lamp, the light from which cast a becoming glow on
her as she selected a chair beside it, and took up her
embroidery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Leigh, good evening,&rdquo; she exclaimed a moment
later as the young officer stood by her. &ldquo;Have
you come to make your peace with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what way have I offended?&rdquo; Wallace asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were so rude to one of my guests at my
tea yesterday.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons watched him as he
made himself comfortable in a dainty settee under
the lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rude to one of your guests? Impossible!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>ejaculated Wallace in surprise. &ldquo;To whom do you
refer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nina Potter.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons had not taken her
eyes off him, and she caught the sudden shifting of
his gaze. &ldquo;Why are you and she no longer friendly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken.&rdquo; Wallace spoke stiffly. &ldquo;We
are&mdash;I am still a great admirer of hers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Kitty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wallace flushed to the roots of his sandy hair.
&ldquo;Kitty never had very much use for me,&rdquo; he admitted,
rather bitterly. &ldquo;She&mdash;she&mdash;seems to be
tired&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of being a cat&rsquo;s paw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Parsons!&rdquo; Wallace was on his feet, his
eyes snapping with anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; smile was ingratiating.
&ldquo;Forgive me if I blunder, Leigh. Sometimes
an outsider sees most of the game. Will you take a
friendly piece of advice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; but Wallace was slow in reseating himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then avoid Ben Potter.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons picked
up her neglected embroidery, and did not trouble to
glance at her guest.</p>

<p>Wallace&rsquo;s attempt at a laugh was something of a
failure. &ldquo;I saw Potter an hour ago at the club,&rdquo; he
volunteered. &ldquo;He told me that he and his wife were
leaving for New York to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons held her needle nearer
the light and threaded it with deft fingers. &ldquo;Is
Kitty Baird going with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe not.&rdquo; Wallace moved a trifle and
shaded his face with his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just come from
&lsquo;Rose Hill.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is Kitty? Did you see her?&rdquo; Mrs.
Parsons spoke with such rapidity that her questions
ran together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Wallace compressed his lips. &ldquo;She sent
down word that she begged to be excused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons lowered her embroidery and
regarded her companion. He looked wretchedly ill,
and the haggard lines were deeper than ever. For
a man of his height and breadth of shoulder, he
seemed to have shrunken, for his clothes appeared
to hang upon him. Dwelling on his ill-health would
not tend to lessen Wallace&rsquo;s nervous condition, and
Mrs. Parsons omitted personalities. &ldquo;Were you at
the Baird inquest?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is, I got there late&mdash;&rdquo; stumbling somewhat
in his speech. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go and see
Kitty, Cecelia? That house of hers is sort of
ghastly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For any one who suffers from nerves,&rdquo; she put
in, and he flushed at the irony of her tone, &ldquo;Kitty
has plenty of courage. I&mdash;&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;I am in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>clined
to think that Kitty has inherited some of her
aunt&rsquo;s prejudices&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t inherit any likes&mdash;that abominable
aunt of hers hated everybody.&rdquo; Wallace spoke
with such bitter feeling that Mrs. Parsons restrained
a smile with difficulty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Kitty,&rdquo; her tone was full of sympathy. &ldquo;I
am glad she has Ted Rodgers to lean on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wallace flushed angrily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the one who has
made all the trouble,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been
for his&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; as Wallace came to an abrupt halt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing.&rdquo; Wallace beat the devil&rsquo;s tattoo
on the chair arm. &ldquo;I must be going, Cecelia. It&rsquo;s a
beastly bore having to turn in early, but I must obey
the doctor&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly should take better care of yourself.&rdquo;
Mrs. Parsons walked with Wallace to the
door of the room. The house was an English basement
in design, and as they came to the top of the
flight of steps leading to the ground floor, Wallace
held out his hand. It felt feverish to the touch and
Mrs. Parsons regarded him with growing concern.
&ldquo;Stop and see Dr. McLean on your way home,&rdquo; she
advised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo; Wallace laughed recklessly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I take a lot of killing. Good night.&rdquo;
And, squeezing her hand until the pressure forced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>her rings into the tender skin, he released it and ran
down the steps.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons lingered long enough to hear James
assisting Wallace into his overcoat and then went
thoughtfully into her drawing room. The footman
had left one of the window shades up and Mrs. Parsons
paused to pull it down. The street was well
lighted from the electric lamp opposite her doorway,
and, as she stood idly looking out of the window,
she saw Major Leigh Wallace start to cross the street,
hesitate at the curb, turn to his left and walk eastward.
He had gone but a short distance when Mrs.
Parsons saw a man slip out from the doorway of
the next house and start down the street after
Wallace. Halfway down the block Wallace crossed
the street and without glancing backward continued
on his way, his shadow at his heels.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons watched them out of sight, her eyes
big with suppressed excitement. When she finally
pulled down the window shade her hand was not
quite steady.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
THE CASE OF THE GILA MONSTER</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">U</span><span class="smcap">naware</span> that he had a place in Mrs.
Parsons&rsquo; meditations as well as in her conversation
with Major Leigh Wallace, Ted
Rogers parked his car near the entrance to &ldquo;Rose
Hill.&rdquo; His ring at the front door bell was answered
by Mandy, the ebony shadow of Oscar, her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kin yo&rsquo; see Miss Kitty?&rdquo; She repeated the
question after him. &ldquo;Why, I &rsquo;spect yo&rsquo; kin, Mister
Rodgers. Jes&rsquo; step inside, Sah, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll go find Miss
Kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Closing the front door and putting up the night
latch with much jingling, Mandy led Rodgers down
the hall to the entrance of the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lamps am lighted in hyar,&rdquo; she said by way
of explanation. &ldquo;Ole Miss never used to let Miss
Kitty have a light in de odder rooms on dis flo&rsquo;,
cept when Oscar was a-servin&rsquo; dinner. An&rsquo; we all
got so we jes&rsquo; never thought o&rsquo; carryin&rsquo; a lamp into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>de parlor. Make yo&rsquo;self comfortable, Sah, I&rsquo;ll tell
Miss Kitty an&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll be down terec&rsquo;ly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a word of thanks Rodgers passed the old
servant and entered the library. The light from the
two oil lamps was supplemented by a cheerful fire
in the brick chimney at the farther end of the room,
and its cheerful glow did much to dispel the dreary
atmosphere which prevailed.</p>

<p>Rodgers did not at once sit down. Instead he
paused in the center of the library and gravely regarded
the tea table and the throne-shaped chair
where he had frequently seen Miss Susan Baird sitting
when entertaining guests at tea. He had a
retentive memory, and as his eyes roved about the
library, he pieced out the scene of the discovery of
the dead woman as described on the witness stand
by Inspector Mitchell.</p>

<p>As far as Rodgers could judge, no change had
been made in the room, except in the arrangement of
the tea table. The soiled dishes and tea cups had
been removed, the tea service cleaned and put back,
and the fruit dish, of Royal Dresden china of ancient
pattern, was empty. Forgetful of the passing time,
he wandered about examining with keen attention
the fine oil paintings of dead and gone Bairds, the
camels&rsquo; hair shawls which had been converted into
portières, the Persian rugs on the hardwood floor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>What matter that all showed traces of wear and tear?
The room was cleanliness personified.</p>

<p>Genteel poverty&mdash;his surroundings cried of it.
Rodgers thought, with a tightening of his heart-strings,
of Kitty&rsquo;s brave endeavor to keep up the old
home and provide her aunt with every comfort within
her means. And her aunt had been murdered.
Murdered! He shook his head in bewilderment.
What possible motive could have inspired such a
crime? Who would murder a poverty-stricken old
woman? Avarice&mdash;where was the gain? Revenge&mdash;for
what? Hate&mdash;why hate a feeble old
woman? There remained robbery as a possible
motive. Could it be that?</p>

<p>Rodgers crossed over to the &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; door and
examined it with interest. Neither its lock nor its
solid panels gave indication of having been forced
open. From the door his attention passed to the
three small windows, placed just under the flooring
of the gallery; they appeared tightly closed and resisted
his efforts to move them. The library gained
its chief light in the daytime from the skylight and
the windows opening upon the gallery.</p>

<p>Turning around, Rodgers stood hesitating, his
head slightly bent to catch the faintest sound. He
had heard, some moments before, Mandy&rsquo;s halting
footsteps as she came limping down the staircase,
then along the hall to the basement stairs, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>shutting of the door after her descending figure. He
looked at his watch; ten minutes had elapsed since
his arrival and still Kitty had not appeared. Surely
she would have sent word by Mandy if she had not
wished him to wait? He took from his pocket a
crumpled note and smoothed it out. The act had
become a habit. He did not need to read the few
lines penned on the paper&mdash;he knew them by heart.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">Come to-night. I must see you. K. B.</p>

<p>He had obeyed the summons eagerly. Kitty had
asked him to find out who killed her aunt. And the
inquest had brought out what?&mdash;that Miss Susan
Baird had come to her death through poison administered
by a party or parties unknown. It had
also disclosed the fact that the last person to see
Miss Susan alive was Kitty Baird, and Oscar had
testified that aunt and niece had quarreled that fatal
Sunday afternoon&mdash;over Major Leigh Wallace.
Rodgers whitened at the thought. Were Kitty and
Wallace really engaged, as he had been given to understand
by no less a person than Ben Potter? If
so, he cut a sorry figure dancing attendance upon
Kitty. She had grown to be all in all to him. It
was a case of the moth and the candle. Rodgers
smiled wryly; he could not tear himself away, even
if he would, and she had asked him to aid her!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>Rodgers squared his shoulders. As soon as the
mystery of Miss Susan Baird&rsquo;s death was solved, he
would leave Washington and give Wallace a clear
field. Kitty was entitled to happiness.</p>

<p>Tired of inaction, harassed by his thought,
Rodgers tramped about the room and finally paused
in front of the fireplace. Mouchette, Kitty&rsquo;s Angora
cat, rolled over at his approach and yawned sleepily.
She had awakened at his entrance, but the comfort
of an excellent dinner and the heat of the fire had
proven too strong to keep her awake, and she had
curled up again and gone to sleep.</p>

<p>The hearth was set far back and two benches
were framed on either hand by the walls of the
chimney. They looked inviting, and, after giving
Mouchette a final pat, Rodgers dropped down on one
of the benches, his broad back braced across the
corner of the wall, while his long legs were stretched
out toward the fire burning so briskly on the hearth.
He watched the play of the firelight with unconscious
intensity, his mind picturing Kitty&rsquo;s alluring personality.
A log broke and as the burning embers
struck the hearth, sparks flew out and upward. One
landed on the bench on which Rodgers was sitting
and he leaned forward to knock it back upon the
hearth. As his hand struck the bench a glancing
blow, he felt the wood give and the next instant he
was gazing into a small hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodgers stared at it in deep surprise. Bending
closer he saw that he must have touched a concealed
spring which released the trap-door. It was not a
large cavity into which he peered, hardly a foot deep
and about six inches square, or so he judged in the
fitful glow of the fire. He sat for a moment perfectly
still, then drawing out his matchbox, struck
a light and held it carefully so that its rays fell
directly into the small hole. It was empty except for
a medium-sized brass key to which was tied a small
tag. Bending nearer, he made out the scrawled lines
with some difficulty:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This key unlocks the inside drawer of the highboy
in the blue room on the fourth floor.</p></div>

<p>A bell reverberating through the silent house
caused Rodgers to spring up and look into the hall,
in time to see Mandy emerge from behind the door
leading to the basement stairs and make her way to
the front of the house. A murmur of voices reached
Rodgers, then a firm tread sounded down the uncarpeted
hall, and parting the portières Charles
Craige walked into the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Rodgers,&rdquo; he exclaimed in hearty greeting.
&ldquo;Mandy told me that you were here. Have
you seen Kitty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; Rodgers shook Craige&rsquo;s hand with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>vigor. He had grown to like and admire the brilliant
lawyer whose many acts of kindness had added to
the enjoyment of his visit. Besides, and Rodgers&rsquo;
eyes glowed, was he not Kitty&rsquo;s godfather!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust Kitty to keep a man waiting,&rdquo; and Craige
smiled as he spoke, then grew grave. &ldquo;This is a
devilish bad business&mdash;not to say shocking. Poor
Susan&mdash;the last person in the world whose death
would have been of benefit to any one, and yet she
was murdered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we are to believe the medical evidence, yes,&rdquo;
replied Rodgers. &ldquo;Poison can be administered with
murderous intent, but we must also remember that
it can be taken with the intent to commit suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True.&rdquo; Craige chose a seat at some distance from
the throne-shaped chair. &ldquo;But I cannot associate
either murder or suicide with Susan. I tell you,
Rodgers, Susan had an intense desire to live, and I
can conceive of no one wishing for her death sufficiently
to face the gallows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the fact remains that she either did away
with herself or was cold-bloodedly murdered,&rdquo; retorted
Rodgers.</p>

<p>Craige nodded his head moodily. &ldquo;If murder, it
was cold-blooded, premeditated murder,&rdquo; he agreed.
&ldquo;Hush, here comes Kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A door had opened on the gallery and Kitty appeared
from her bedroom, stood for a moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>hesitating, then hurrying forward she almost ran
down the short flight of steps to the library. She
paused by the newel post as both men advanced to
meet her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad you are here,&rdquo; she exclaimed, extending
her hands impulsively to each. &ldquo;It has been
so dreadful&mdash;alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige laid a sympathetic hand on her shoulder
and patted her gently as he kissed her. &ldquo;We understand,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Now, what can we do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers, who still held Kitty&rsquo;s hand in both of
his, released it reluctantly. He was slow of speech,
but his eyes, meeting Kitty&rsquo;s gaze, conveyed a message
all their own. As Kitty preceded them across
the library, a warm blush mantled her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit here, Miss Baird.&rdquo; Rodgers placed a chair
for her near the chimney while Craige pulled forward
two others. Grateful for the warmth from
the fire, for her bedroom was insufficiently heated,
Kitty stretched out her hands to the blaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is your telephone disconnected, Kitty?&rdquo;
asked Craige, after a brief silence which neither
Kitty or Rodgers made any attempt to break.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were deluged with calls,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;Especially the newspaper reporters.&rdquo; She shivered
slightly. &ldquo;They gave Mandy no rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to cut yourself off from your friends, Kitty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>was that wise?&rdquo; chided Craige gently. &ldquo;No one
could reach you&mdash;I tried and failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It did not stop your coming over to ask for me,&rdquo;
she put in gratefully. &ldquo;Ben and Nina Potter stopped
for a second before dinner. They left for New
York to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; Craige frowned. &ldquo;They should have
remained here with you,&rdquo; noting with concern the
dark shadows under her eyes and the forlorn droop
to her usually erect shoulders. &ldquo;You must not stay
here alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am not alone,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Dear, faithful
Mandy is with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige shook his head, unsatisfied. &ldquo;Mandy is
an ignorant colored woman, old at that,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;You must have companionship&mdash;woman&rsquo;s
companionship of your own class. Why not ask
Cecilia Parsons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I would not think of asking her,&rdquo; Kitty objected
quickly. &ldquo;She is so&mdash;so sensitive, so&mdash;&rdquo;
hunting about for the proper word. &ldquo;Oh, the house,
all this&mdash;would get frightfully on her nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At mention of Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; name, Rodgers
glanced from one to the other, finally letting his gaze
rest on the lawyer&rsquo;s kindly, clever face. He had
heard the rumor connecting the pretty widow&rsquo;s
name with Charles Craige, and that reports of their
engagement persisted, in spite of Mrs. Parsons&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>laughing denial and Craige&rsquo;s skillfully evasive answers
to all questions on the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please, Kitty,&rdquo; replied Craige. &ldquo;But I
think that you are wrong not to ask Mrs. Parsons.
She would not hesitate to tell you if she did not wish
to come. She is frankness itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty raised her eyebrows and a ghost of a smile
crossed her lips. &ldquo;Mrs. Parsons is always most
kind,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;but I prefer not to tax her
friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The look Craige cast in her direction was a bit
sharp, and with some abruptness he changed the
subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you wise to have your aunt&rsquo;s body put in
the vault this afternoon, Kitty?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Did
you not overtax your strength? You look so utterly
weary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am stronger than I appear.&rdquo; Kitty passed her
hand across her eyes. &ldquo;I could see no object in
waiting. Coroner Penfield suggested that we have
simple funeral ceremonies immediately after the inquest.
I tried to get word to you, but failed. It was
but prolonging the agony to wait&mdash;&rdquo; with a catch
in her throat, &ldquo;there was nothing to be gained by
waiting. It would not bring her back. Oh, poor
Aunt Susan!&rdquo; And bowing her head Kitty gave
vent to the tears she had held back for many, many
hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodgers watched her in unhappy silence. Could
he find nothing to say&mdash;do nothing to comfort her?
He half rose impulsively to his feet&mdash;caught Craige&rsquo;s
eye and sat down again. Craige leaned forward
and put his arms about the weeping girl and soothed
her with loving words. When she grew more composed,
he rose and paced up and down the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had I not better call Mandy and let her put you
to bed, Kitty?&rdquo; he asked, stopping by her chair.
&ldquo;You can see us to-morrow when you are more
composed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, wait.&rdquo; Kitty sat up and attempted to smile.
&ldquo;I am all right, now. Is it true, as the papers said,
that Aunt Susan died from poison placed on a peach
she was eating?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we are to believe the medical evidence, yes.
Chemical tests proved that prussic acid still remained
on one side of the blade of the fruit knife used to
cut the peach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty shuddered. &ldquo;Who could have planned so
diabolical a murder?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is for us to find out.&rdquo; Kitty looked up
quickly at sound of Rodgers&rsquo; clear voice. &ldquo;Tell me,
Miss Baird, have you no idea where the peaches
came from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest,&rdquo; she shook her head. &ldquo;I am
positive there were no peaches in the house when I
left here Sunday afternoon. They are very ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>pensive
at this season of the year and,&rdquo; with downright
frankness, &ldquo;we could not afford to buy them,
although Aunt Susan was inordinately fond of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one must have sent the peaches who was
aware of your aunt&rsquo;s liking for the fruit,&rdquo; Craige
remarked thoughtfully. &ldquo;Had she spoken of peaches
to any of your friends lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friends!&rdquo; Kitty looked at him with dawning
horror. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean that a
<i>friend</i> killed Aunt Susan?&rdquo; She thrust out her
hands as if warding off some frightful nightmare.
&ldquo;No, no. It was a housebreaker&mdash;a common, ordinary
housebreaker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may have been a housebreaker,&rdquo; agreed
Rodgers, soothingly. &ldquo;But it was one with the
knowledge that the flavor of a peach would disguise
the taste of prussic acid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; Craige spoke with deep seriousness.
&ldquo;You must realize that this murder of your aunt
was a deliberately planned crime. Burglars don&rsquo;t
go around carrying bottles of prussic acid in their
pockets. Also, there is one point of especial significance&mdash;but
one side of the knife-blade had poison
on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;?&rdquo; She questioned him with
frightened eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That some one whom your aunt knew must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>been taking tea with her, and in administering the
poison saw to it that <i>his</i> side of the peach was harmless,&rdquo;
Craige responded.</p>

<p>Kitty looked at the two men dumbly. Craige had
put into words what she had dimly realized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is dreadful!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;What possible
motive could have inspired her murder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige looked at Rodgers, then drawing out his
leather wallet he selected a newspaper clipping and
ran his eyes down the printed column.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us, Kitty,&rdquo; and his voice was coaxing. &ldquo;Is it
true that you and your aunt quarreled on Sunday as
Oscar testified?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty blanched and her eyes shifted from Rodgers
to the glowing embers on the hearth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a quarrel,&rdquo; she declared faintly. &ldquo;Aunt
Susan and I had a few words&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; prompted Craige. &ldquo;A few words about
what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About money matters.&rdquo; Kitty did not look at
either man. Rodgers&rsquo; heart sank. Oscar had also
testified that the quarrel was about Major Leigh
Wallace. Could it be that Kitty was prevaricating?
He put the thought from him. Oscar <i>must</i> have
lied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About money matters,&rdquo; Craig repeated, returning
the clipping and wallet to his pocket. &ldquo;Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>why did you not tell that to Coroner Penfield when
he questioned you in the witness stand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t his business&mdash;it had nothing to do with
Aunt Susan&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; she stated incoherently.
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; with a slow, painful blush, &ldquo;our poverty,
our painful economies were bad enough without discussing
them in public.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Craige cast a doubtful look at Rodgers,
but the latter&rsquo;s expressionless face gave the keen-witted
lawyer no clue as to his opinion of Kitty&rsquo;s
statement. &ldquo;Kitty, were you your aunt&rsquo;s nearest
relative?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Ben Potter is a second cousin, I believe.&rdquo;
Kitty paused. &ldquo;Ben has not been here very much
lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since his marriage, you mean?&rdquo; asked Craige.</p>

<p>Kitty glanced up and then away. &ldquo;Yes. Aunt
Susan poked fun at him at the time of his marriage,
said she did not care for &lsquo;poor whites,&rsquo; and Ben was
very angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there ever an open quarrel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Outwardly, they were good friends;
and they dined here usually once a month,&rdquo; Kitty
explained. &ldquo;But relations were strained a little bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you not make Ben and Nina a visit when
they return from New York?&rdquo; asked Craige.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can, if I wish,&rdquo; with quick resentment. &ldquo;But
I prefer to stay in this house.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, Kitty,&rdquo; Craige held up a cautioning
hand. &ldquo;This house belonged to your aunt,
did it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But I&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated. &ldquo;I ran the house
with the money I earned. I can still do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, if the house is left to you.&rdquo; Kitty stared
at her godfather aghast. &ldquo;Did your aunt leave her
will in your care?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she ever speak to you of a will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; she never mentioned the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige looked at her thoughtfully. &ldquo;It may be
that your aunt made no will,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;I
transacted such legal matters as she brought to me,
but I never drew up a will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But as Miss Baird is her aunt&rsquo;s nearest living
relative, would she not inherit her aunt&rsquo;s property?&rdquo;
asked Rodgers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly; but Ben Potter may claim his share of
the estate,&rdquo; the lawyer pointed out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Estate!&rdquo; broke in Kitty with a nervous laugh.
&ldquo;Poor Aunt Susan had only this house and its dilapidated
furniture. Ben is welcome to his share.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; Craige interrupted in his turn.
&ldquo;Your aunt must have left a will or some legal document
regarding the disposal of her property. She
had a great habit of tucking her papers away. You
recollect our search for the tax receipts, Kitty?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Kitty&rsquo;s face brightened into one of her mischievous
smiles, while her eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Susan was secretive,&rdquo; she acknowledged.
&ldquo;It was a case of searching for lump sugar even,
when she was in the mood for hiding things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hiding!&rdquo; Rodgers rose to his feet and his eyes
sought the bench where he had found the trap-door.
&ldquo;Come here, Miss Baird,&rdquo; and he beckoned them to
approach. &ldquo;I opened that by accident just before
Mr. Craige arrived&mdash;see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty slipped her hand inside the cavity and drew
out the key.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember the trap-door,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you
press on a spring concealed in one of the boards,
the door drops inward. But what does this tag
mean?&rdquo; and they read the words aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This key unlocks the inside drawer of the highboy
in the blue room on the fourth floor.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go and see what it means,&rdquo; suggested
Rodgers, and Craige nodded his agreement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead the way, Kitty,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Do you need
a lamp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a candlestick outside my bedroom door,
and we can light the gas jets as we go through the
halls,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>Pausing only long enough to pick up several small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>match boxes, she led the way out of the library and
up the long staircase. A light was burning dimly
in the first hall and Rodgers turned it up before
following Kitty and her godfather to the next story.
From there they hurried to the fourth floor, Kitty&rsquo;s
candle but intensifying the darkness.</p>

<p>The stuffy atmosphere of a room long unused
greeted them as they entered a large square room
facing the front of the house. With the aid of her
candle, Kitty located the one gas jet and by its
feeble rays they looked about them. The room
evidently obtained its name from its faded blue wall
paper. The old four-post bed and the massive
mahogany furniture belonged to another and richer
generation, but Rodgers had no time to investigate
its beauties, his attention being focussed on a highboy
standing near one of the windows. Kitty again
read the message on the tag before approaching the
highboy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The inside drawer,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;What does
she mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer Rodgers pulled open the nearest
drawer. It was filled with old finery, and after
tumbling its contents about, Kitty closed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try the next,&rdquo; suggested Craige. The second
drawer proved equally unproductive of result, and
it was with growing discouragement that they went
through the next three and found them also unin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>teresting.
On pulling out the last drawer Kitty
found it arranged as a writing desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen this kind before,&rdquo; Rodgers felt along
the front of the drawer; there was a faint click and
the front woodwork swung aside, disclosing an inside
drawer.</p>

<p>Kitty slipped the key she was carrying into the
lock. It turned with a slight squeaking sound, showing
the need of oil, and Kitty drew open the drawer.
Inside it lay another brass key also tagged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it say?&rdquo; she asked as Rodgers picked
it up.</p>

<p>He read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This key unlocks the lower left hand drawer of
the sideboard in the dining room.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Is that your aunt&rsquo;s handwriting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Kitty looked as mystified as she felt.
&ldquo;Shall we go downstairs and look in the sideboard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; As he spoke, Craige started for
the door. It took them but a few minutes to reach
the dining room, and it was with a sense of rising
excitement that Kitty unlocked the &ldquo;lower left hand
drawer&rdquo; of the sideboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! Another key!&rdquo; she gasped, and
held it up so that both men could read the tag tied
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The message ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This key unlocks the linen trunk in the attic.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word your aunt outdid herself!&rdquo; exclaimed
Craige. &ldquo;Come, Kitty, as long as we have
started this investigation, we must complete it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not having anticipated having to return to the
top of the house, Rodgers had carefully put out all
the lights, and relighting the gas jets delayed them
somewhat. Kitty&rsquo;s candle had almost burned itself
out when they entered the cold and unfriendly attic.
No gas pipes had been placed there, and Rodgers
was thankful that his electric torch, which he carried
when motoring at night, was in his pocket. By
its rays Kitty recognized the old-fashioned brass-bound
hair trunk in which her aunt had kept some
precious pieces of hand woven linen.</p>

<p>Crouching down on the floor with Rodgers holding
his torch so that she could see the best, Kitty
turned the key in the lock and threw back the lid
of the trunk. On the spotless white linen lay a
small brass key with a tag twice its size. The message
it bore read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This key unlocks the case of the Gila monster.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The case of the Gila monster,&rdquo; repeated Rodgers.
&ldquo;What did your aunt mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; Kitty clapped her hands. &ldquo;Ben Potter
spent the summer with Aunt Susan two years ago
and he left one of his cases here. It contains the
plaster cast of a Gila monster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where is the case?&rdquo; asked Craige.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let us go there at once. You will catch
cold up in this icy place, Kitty.&rdquo; Observing that she
was shivering, Craige closed the trunk with a resounding
bang, drew out the key, and preceded them
out of the attic.</p>

<p>Back in the library again, Kitty walked over to a
Japanese screen, which cut off one corner of the
room, and pushing it aside, disclosed a low oak case
on which rested a glass box. Inside the box lay the
cast of a Gila monster. The poisonous lizard looked
so alive that Rodgers was startled for a moment.
Bending closer, he viewed its wedge-shaped head
and black and yellow mottled body with deep interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that is the end of our search!&rdquo; Kitty laughed
ruefully. &ldquo;Aunt Susan had a remarkable sense of
humor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; exclaimed Rodgers. &ldquo;Why not unlock
the case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish&mdash;&rdquo; Kitty inserted the key in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>lock and pulled down the glass door of the box, and
she and her companions stared silently at the monster.
Suddenly, Rodgers leaned forward and picked
up the plaster cast. An exclamation broke from
Craige.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papers at last!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Look, Kitty&mdash;Rodgers&mdash;&rdquo;
and as Rodgers removed the cast entirely
out of the glass case, they saw that a part of
the flooring of the box, which was built to resemble
a sandy desert, came with the lizard, leaving a
cavity, or false bottom, in which lay some documents.
Gathering them up, Craige walked over to
the nearest lamp and drawing up a chair sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your permission, Kitty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These
papers are not sealed&mdash;shall I open them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige pulled out a short half sheet of foolscap
from the first envelope and read its contents aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Know all present that I, Susan Baird, spinster, of
Washington, D. C., being of sound mind, do give
and devise to my niece, Katrina Baird, all I may die
possessed of, real or personal property. This is a
special bequest in view of her efforts to support me.</p>

<p>A list of my property and a key to my safe deposit
boxes in the bank, certificates of ownership,
etc., are placed here with this, my last will and testament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p class="no-indent">Signed in the presence of:<br />
Josiah Wilkins, Martha Hammond, and James Duncan, June 20, 1918.</p>

<p class="right">Susan Baird.</p></div>

<p>Kitty and Rodgers stared at each other as Craige,
laying aside the will, rapidly opened the three other
documents and examined them. Kitty drew a long,
long breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I get the old house after all,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You get far more than that, Kitty,&rdquo; Craige laid
down the documents. &ldquo;From these statements and
certificates I find that your aunt owned many valuable
stocks and bonds.&rdquo; He looked at the surprised
girl for a moment, then added: &ldquo;She has left you
a fortune.&rdquo;</p>

MRS. PARSONS ASKS QUESTIONS</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">ashington</span> society, or such portions
of it as had known Miss Susan Baird in
her lifetime, was agog over the latest development
in the Baird tragedy; while Washingtonians
personally unacquainted with the spinster were
equally interested from motives of curiosity in the
filing of her will. And all Washington, figuratively
speaking, rubbed its eyes and read the newspapers
assiduously, without, however, gaining much satisfaction.
News from Police Headquarters was
scant, and reporters resorted to theories in place of
facts in trying to solve the murder of the &ldquo;Miser of
Rose Hill.&rdquo; Miss Susan Baird, in death, had
emerged from the obscurity which had shrouded her
in life.</p>

<p>Inspector Mitchell leaned forward in his chair,
rested his elbows on the highly polished mahogany
table-top and contemplated Mrs. Parsons with speculative
interest. Three quarters of an hour before
he had received a telephone message requesting him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>to call upon her on, as her servant had stated, urgent
business. He had spent ten minutes in conversation
with Mrs. Parsons and had not received the faintest
inkling as to why she wished to see him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask, Madam,&rdquo; he began with direct bluntness,
&ldquo;what it is that you wish to see me about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons looked across the &ldquo;den&rdquo; to make
sure that the door was closed. Satisfied on that
point, she turned her attention to the inspector.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am anxious to have your bureau undertake a
certain investigation for me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will
gladly meet all expenses, no matter how large they
may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; broke in Mitchell. &ldquo;Do you
mean a private investigation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; somewhat doubtfully. &ldquo;You
might term it that. I want certain information
about a&mdash;a person&rsquo;s past career&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped as Mitchell shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are public officials, Madam, employed by the
District Government,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;What you
require is a private detective.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are they not untrustworthy?&rdquo; she questioned.
&ldquo;I was told they very often sold you out to the
person you wished watched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are crooks in all trades, Madam,&rdquo; replied
Mitchell. &ldquo;There are also honest men. You are not
obliged to pick a crooked detective to work for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just it&mdash; Can you recommend a trustworthy
person to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To what, Madam?&rdquo; as she came to a stammering
halt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To learn certain facts in a person&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; She
plucked nervously at her handkerchief as she waited
for his answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have to be more explicit, Madam,&rdquo; he
said gravely. &ldquo;Whose past life do you wish investigated
and why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons paused in indecision; then with an
air of perfect candor addressed the impatient inspector.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you will respect my confidence,&rdquo; she
began. Mitchell nodded. &ldquo;There is a certain man
in Washington who has gained a welcome in the
most exclusive homes,&rdquo; she paused. &ldquo;I believe him
to be an adventurer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Mrs. Parsons, that is not being very explicit,&rdquo;
remonstrated Mitchell. &ldquo;To whom are you
alluding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man calling himself Edward Rodgers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell sat back and regarded her in unconcealed
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edward Rodgers,&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;You surely do
not mean Edward Rodgers, the handwriting expert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; His profound astonishment was a sap to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>her vanity, and she could not restrain a smile. It
vanished suddenly as a thought recurred to her.
&ldquo;You have promised, Inspector, not to repeat what
I tell you. I depend upon you to keep your word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Mitchell reddened. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t break
confidences, Madam. But you have said too much
not to say more. What are your reasons for claiming
that Edward Rodgers is an adventurer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons did not reply at once and Mitchell
studied her with covert interest. She was dressed
in exquisite taste and the delicate rose-tint of her
complexion had been applied with such consummate
skill that even the uncompromising glare of a March
morning betrayed no signs of make-up to the sharp
eyes of her visitor. Mitchell had always been more
or less susceptible to women&rsquo;s wiles, and his stiff
official manner had thawed perceptibly when she had
welcomed him with a cordiality very gratifying to
his <i>amour propre</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some years ago,&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons spoke in so low
a tone that Mitchell was obliged to lean forward
to catch what she said. &ldquo;My husband, then a practicing
attorney in San Francisco, had a client, Jacob
Brown, a man of supposed wealth and standing in
the community. Gradually, I do not know why,
certain business transactions in which Brown was
involved became questionable, but it was not until
the Holt will case&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Holt will case!&rdquo; Inspector Mitchell drew
back sharply. &ldquo;Hah! Jake Brown&mdash;&lsquo;Gentleman
Jake?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, just so.&rdquo; She looked at him admiringly.
&ldquo;You have an excellent memory, Inspector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where crime is concerned,&rdquo; he admitted, with
a touch of pride. &ldquo;Let me see, Gentleman Jake was
one of the beneficiaries in Colonel Holt&rsquo;s will at a
time when his financial affairs were in bad shape&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In fact, Gentleman Jake was a ruined man&mdash;&rdquo;
she supplemented softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; Mitchell warmed to his subject. &ldquo;And
according to the will, Colonel Holt left him a hundred
thousand dollars. Then along came a nephew
who dug up another will and claimed that the one
leaving the legacy to Gentleman Jake was a clever
forgery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the nephew won his case through the expert
testimony of Edward Rodgers, handwriting expert,&rdquo;
added Mrs. Parsons. &ldquo;Gentleman Jake was sent to
the penitentiary and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Died before his term was up,&rdquo; Mitchell completed
the sentence for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But before he died he sent for my husband,&rdquo;
Mrs. Parsons paused, then spoke more rapidly.
&ldquo;Jake Brown trusted my husband: he had stood by
him and aided in his defense. On his death-bed
Jake confessed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That <i>his</i> Holt will was a forgery,&rdquo; interrupted
Mitchell, pleased that he could again piece out her
story and thereby prove his recollection of the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was his public confession,&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons
lowered her voice. &ldquo;What he told my husband under
pledge of secrecy was that the <i>second</i> will was also a
forgery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Second will?&rdquo; sharply. &ldquo;You mean the will produced
by the nephew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, good gracious!&rdquo; Mitchell rubbed his
head, perplexed in mind. &ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t it proven
a forgery then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because its legality was never questioned. You
will recall that Colonel Holt&rsquo;s nephew produced letters
and documents to prove his claim, and&mdash;&rdquo; with
a quiet smile&mdash;&ldquo;every one&rsquo;s attention was centered
on Jake Brown and the will he fostered. Jake <i>knew</i>
his will was a forgery and his entire effort was to
evade the law. It was not until he was serving his
sentence that Jake&rsquo;s suspicions were aroused, and it
was one of his fellow convicts who gave him the
tip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what was the tip?&rdquo; asked Mitchell, as she
paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Edward Rodgers turned his expert knowledge
of handwriting and his skillful penmanship to
good account&mdash;&rdquo; calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jake told my husband that Edward Rodgers
examined the spurious will when it was first offered
for probate and discovered that it was a forgery.
Keeping his knowledge to himself, Mr. Rodgers
communicated with Colonel Holt&rsquo;s nephew and, for
a consideration, drew up the will leaving all Colonel
Holt&rsquo;s fortune to the nephew&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come,&rdquo; Mitchell&rsquo;s smile was skeptical. &ldquo;The
nephew, as next of kin, would have inherited the
property when the first will was proven a forgery;
for in that event Colonel Holt died intestate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there was another relative who should have
shared Colonel Holt&rsquo;s fortune in case the Colonel
died without leaving a will,&rdquo; she explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus, to inherit his uncle&rsquo;s wealth the nephew
had to produce a will in his favor,&rdquo; she went on.
&ldquo;It was clever to present a second spurious will under
the protection, you might say, of a detected forged
will around which interest centered. As far as I
know, the second will was so cleverly drawn that it
never aroused suspicion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And thus the nephew inherited his uncle&rsquo;s
money.&rdquo; Mitchell stroked his chin thoughtfully.
&ldquo;What was Gentleman Jake&rsquo;s object in telling
this&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated, torn between a sense of politeness
and unbelief, &ldquo;this story to your husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Jake said that he confided in him hoping that
Mr. Parsons could catch Edward Rodgers tripping
some day and send him to the &lsquo;pen,&rsquo;&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did your husband place any faith in Jake&rsquo;s
yarn?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;A cornered crook, like a cornered
cat, will fight&mdash;and lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On his death-bed?&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;I
think not. What had Jake to gain then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, did your husband take any steps in exposing
the second will?&rdquo; asked Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My husband,&rdquo; her expression altered to one of
deep sadness, &ldquo;was killed in an automobile accident
shortly after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Mitchell coughed slightly to cover his embarrassment.
&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amos often discussed his cases with me,&rdquo; she
added. &ldquo;And Gentleman Jake&rsquo;s statements had
aroused him to an unusual degree. He was thunderstruck
at the effrontery of the crime and at its cleverness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a clever scheme,&rdquo; acknowledged Mitchell,
&ldquo;and probably succeeded through its very boldness.
But, pardon me, Madam, you have brought forward
no proof to substantiate your story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am coming to that.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons rose and
walking over to a closet, beckoned to the inspector.
Opening the door, she knelt down before a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>safe used to hold her table silver. From one of its
compartments she took out a worn envelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot to tell you,&rdquo; she stated, shutting the
door of the safe, &ldquo;that the fellow convict who gave
the tip to Gentleman Jake was up for burglary.
Some time previous to his arrest he had entered Edward
Rodgers&rsquo; apartment in San Francisco and,
among other things, stolen these papers. He sent
them to my husband when released from the &lsquo;pen.&rsquo;
See for yourself,&rdquo; and she handed the envelope to
Mitchell.</p>

<p>Returning to his old seat, Inspector Mitchell shook
the contents of the envelope on the table, then laying
it down he picked up a yellowish paper, which
bore the signature: &ldquo;John Holt&rdquo; written over and
over. The reverse was a letter in a stiff, Spencerian
handwriting:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dear Rodgers:</p>

<p>Call at my office to-morrow. I plan to destroy
my last will, and would like you to locate my nephew,
Leigh Wallace, for me.</p>

<p class="right2">Yours,</p>

<p class="right">John Holt.</p></div>

<p>Without comment Mitchell laid aside the letter
and picked up another paper. It bore the same signature,
traced in varying forms of completeness, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>in one corner the name, &ldquo;Leigh Wallace,&rdquo; was repeated
again and again. The third and last paper
was in the stiff handwriting of the letter signed by
John Holt, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I, John Holt, being in good health and of sound
mind, do hereby revoke all other instruments and
do declare this to be my last will and testament. I
give and bequeath to my nephew, Leigh Wallace&mdash;</p></div>
<p>The remainder of the page was blank except for
a large smudge of ink.</p>

<p>Inspector Mitchell laid the three sheets of paper
side by side and examined them with care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leigh Wallace,&rdquo; he said smilingly. &ldquo;Is he any
relation to the Major Leigh Wallace over whom
Miss Baird and her niece, Miss Kitty, are said by
Oscar to have quarreled on Sunday shortly before
Miss Baird&rsquo;s murder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is the same man.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons pushed
aside the vase of flowers standing on the table so that
she could obtain an unobstructed view of Mitchell
and the papers lying in front of him. &ldquo;Strange, is
it not, that Major Leigh Wallace and Edward
Rodgers should both be in Washington and both
interested in the Baird murder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why strange?&rdquo; Inspector Mitchell was not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>be drawn. &ldquo;All Washington is interested in Miss
Susan Baird&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not with such a <i>personal</i> interest.&rdquo; Mrs.
Parsons&rsquo; voice was honey sweet. &ldquo;Edward Rodgers
has promised to aid in tracing her murderer. Also,
Colonel Holt was Kitty Baird&rsquo;s uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;then she is the other relative you alluded
to&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;Colonel Holt died intestate
and his property should have been divided
equally between his nearest of kin, Kitty Baird, and
her cousin, Leigh Wallace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the forged will gave the entire fortune to
Wallace,&rdquo; Mitchell spoke slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which he has squandered,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Leigh
Wallace is cursed with an inherited vice&mdash;a craze
for gambling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inspector Mitchell raised his head and regarded
Mrs. Parsons. The silence lasted fully a minute,
then picking up the three papers he replaced them
in the worn envelope and pocketed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have given me valuable information,&rdquo; he
said, rising. &ldquo;It will not be necessary to call in a
private detective. Good morning, Mrs. Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

RUMORS</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> clerks in the outer office of &ldquo;Craige and
Lewis, Attorneys&rdquo; looked up as the hall door
opened with an unmistakable wrench and
Ben Potter precipitated himself into the room. He
brought up with some abruptness before the chief
clerk&rsquo;s desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my card at once to Mr. Craige,&rdquo; he directed.
&ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;m in the devil&rsquo;s hurry&mdash;late for
an appointment now. Thank you,&rdquo; as an office boy
hurried forward with a chair. &ldquo;I prefer to stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chief clerk, with one look at Potter&rsquo;s determined
expression, decided it was best to swallow
his dignity and execute Potter&rsquo;s peremptory request.
He returned with unusual speed from the inner
office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craige will see you at once, Sir,&rdquo; he announced,
holding the door open for Potter and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>swinging it to behind him with a sharp bang, as a
slight vent to his ruffled feelings.</p>

<p>Potter had crossed the room before he realized
that he and Craige, who had risen at his entrance,
were not alone. His angry frown gave way to a
smile when the third man turned more fully toward
him and he recognized Edward Rodgers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Ted, I&rsquo;m glad you are here,&rdquo; he exclaimed
as Craige pulled another chair for his guest before
resuming his seat. Potter sat down heavily and
tossed his hat and cane on the desk. &ldquo;Say, Craige,
what the deuce does this mean?&rdquo; and unfolding a
newspaper, which he had held tightly clenched in
his left hand, he pointed to a column of news, under
the heading:</p>

<p class="center no-indent">Miss Susan Baird Wills Fortune to Niece</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means what it says,&rdquo; explained Craige. &ldquo;Miss
Susan Baird left Kitty an heiress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter&rsquo;s prominent pale blue eyes were opened to
their widest extent. &ldquo;C-c-cousin S-s-susan!&rdquo; he
stuttered. &ldquo;That forlorn old pauper left a fortune!
Why, Craige, I fully expected to be called on to pay
her funeral expenses. You mean to tell me, in all
earnestness, that Cousin Susan had any money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did not have &lsquo;any money,&rsquo; she had a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>fortune,&rdquo; declared Craige, laughing outright at Potter&rsquo;s
ludicrous expression of bewilderment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I am to understand that this newspaper
is correct in its statements?&rdquo; Potter asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are&mdash;&rdquo; Craige leaned over and looked at
the date on the newspaper. &ldquo;You are a bit behind-hand,
Ben. That paper of yours is a day old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve only just seen it,&rdquo; Potter&rsquo;s tone had
grown querulous. &ldquo;I had to run on to New York
night before last&mdash;the night of the inquest, to be
exact, and Nina and I only got in this morning, having
taken the midnight train. This paper was the
first I opened when we reached home, and its account
of Cousin Susan&rsquo;s will astounded me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It took our breath away also,&rdquo; admitted Craige.
&ldquo;Rodgers was with us when we found the will; in
fact it was through his agency that it was found at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter swung around so hastily in his endeavor to
face Rodgers that he knocked his cane off the desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know there was a will?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Oh, never mind about the cane; let it
stay on the floor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rodgers had no knowledge of the will&rsquo;s existence
any more than the rest of us,&rdquo; declared Craige before
Rodgers, who had stooped to pick up Potter&rsquo;s
cane, had a chance to answer the latter&rsquo;s question.
&ldquo;He happened to open a trap-door to a hiding place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>in which lay directions, written by Susan Baird,
telling us where to find her papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter stared at his companions in unbounded
astonishment. It was some moments before he collected
his wits sufficiently to ask a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;and how, in the name of
God, did Cousin Susan acquire her wealth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige shook a bewildered head. &ldquo;I cannot answer
that question,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;It is one that
has puzzled me hourly since the finding of her will
and the discovery of her investments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are all genuine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely; gilt edged, most of them.&rdquo; Again
Craige shook his head. &ldquo;Miss Susan showed rare
judgment in her investments, rare even in an experienced
man of business, and in a woman who
posed as a pauper&mdash;good Lord!&rdquo; He raised his
hands and dropped them with an expressive gesture.
&ldquo;In all my legal experience the whole affair, her
death, her wealth&mdash;is the most remarkable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Considering them together, does not her wealth
suggest a motive for her death?&rdquo; asked Rodgers,
breaking his long silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who knew that she was wealthy?&rdquo; demanded
Potter. &ldquo;Was ever a secret so well kept?&rdquo; He
stopped abruptly as a thought occurred to him and
his expression altered. &ldquo;How about Kitty? Was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>she in the dark, too, or was she aware that her aunt
owned a large fortune?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was entirely ignorant of it.&rdquo; Rodgers spoke
with marked emphasis, and Potter favored him with
a heavy scowl. &ldquo;Kitty Baird had no idea that her
aunt was anything but the pauper she pretended to
be. On that I&rsquo;ll stake my reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter&rsquo;s scowl gave away to an expression of
doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd, in fact, it&rsquo;s damned odd!&rdquo; he exploded.
&ldquo;Kitty lived with her aunt, lived alone with
her. How could she help but know of her aunt&rsquo;s
financial affairs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you question Kitty,&rdquo; suggested Craige,
with a swift glance at Rodger&rsquo;s lowering countenance.
&ldquo;The girl, in my opinion, knew absolutely
nothing about her aunt&rsquo;s hoarded wealth&mdash;for it was
hoarded, hoarded even from her, her only living
relative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on there, I&rsquo;m a relative, also,&rdquo; objected
Potter. &ldquo;She and my father were second cousins.
By the way,&rdquo; with a complete change of tone, &ldquo;was
there any mention of me in the will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was not.&rdquo; At Craige&rsquo;s curt reply Potter
frowned again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she left me out of it, did she?&rdquo; He shrugged
his shoulders with well-simulated indifference. &ldquo;Did
Cousin Susan name an executor and did she leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>her fortune to Kitty in trust, or give it to her outright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She left it to Kitty without reservations,&rdquo; replied
Craige. &ldquo;Kitty applied to the Court to appoint
me co-executor with herself, and the court has
granted her request and permitted us to-day to take
out letters of administration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so.&rdquo; Potter reached for his hat and buttoned
up his overcoat which he had kept on during
the interview. &ldquo;Do I understand, Ted, that you are
seriously trying to solve the mystery of Cousin
Susan&rsquo;s murder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter rose. His usual genial manner was absent
and also his ready smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has it occurred to you, Ted,&rdquo; he said, and his
voice was rasping; &ldquo;that the person to benefit by
Cousin Susan&rsquo;s death is the one person known to
have quarreled with her during the afternoon of
the day in which she was murdered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; Rodgers was on his feet, advancing
toward the naturalist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; Potter spoke with deliberation, his eyes
not dropping before Rodgers&rsquo; furious gaze. &ldquo;I
mean that Kitty first quarreled with her aunt and
now most opportunely inherits her fortune&mdash;so that
she can marry Leigh Wallace, who can&rsquo;t afford to
marry a poor girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodgers&rsquo; powerful grip on Potter&rsquo;s throat was
loosened by Craige.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop this quarreling!&rdquo; commanded the lawyer.
&ldquo;Stop it, I say,&rdquo; and he shook Rodgers vehemently
as he backed him away from Potter. &ldquo;Go, Ben;
I&rsquo;ll join you later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige did not release his hold on Rodgers until
Potter, still gasping from his encounter with the
former, reeled out of the office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has come over you, Rodgers?&rdquo; he asked,
letting go his hold so suddenly that Rodgers staggered
backward. &ldquo;Why did you fly at Potter in that
manner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dirty blackguard!&rdquo; Rodgers actually stammered
in his rage. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear him? Why,
he had the audacity to infer that because old Oscar
overheard a wordy row between Kitty and her aunt,
that Kitty killed the old lady and so inherited her
fortune&mdash;to marry&mdash;&rdquo; he choked. &ldquo;Why, damn it!
There are a dozen men who would marry Kitty if
she hadn&rsquo;t a cent in the world&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo; his face
paled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige looked at him with admiring approval. &ldquo;I
like your loyalty,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;As for Potter&mdash;&rdquo;
he struck his desk with his clenched fist. &ldquo;Potter
has grown insufferable. Matrimony doesn&rsquo;t appear
to agree with him.&rdquo; He stepped back to his desk
and picked up his brief case. When he turned again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>to Rodgers, who stood waiting by the door, the
gravity of his manner struck the younger man.
&ldquo;There is no use blinding ourselves to the situation,
Rodgers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is up to us to solve the mystery
of Susan Baird&rsquo;s death. If we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he
paused, &ldquo;Kitty may find herself in a most unpleasant
predicament.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mystery is going to be solved&mdash;and quickly,&rdquo;
Rodgers checked his hasty speech. &ldquo;Are you on
your way to the Court House, Mr. Craige?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Craige followed Rodgers through the
outer office, pausing only long enough to be assisted
into his overcoat by an attentive office boy, and joined
him at the elevator. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Potter worry you,
Rodgers; give him time to cool off. I imagine the
news that Susan Baird was a wealthy woman, and
that she never left him a red cent is responsible for
his irritability. You know Ben is rather inclined to
love money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm, yes. I can well believe that he is blood-kin
in that respect to Miss Susan Baird,&rdquo; and Rodgers,
his temper somewhat restored, waved a friendly
hand to Craige as they left the elevator and went
their several ways.</p>

<p>Once in the street Rodgers moved with dragging
footsteps toward his car, his thought elsewhere.
Suddenly he became conscious that, as deliberately
as he walked, some one just ahead of him was mov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>ing
even more slowly. Stepping to one side, he
moved forward at a more rapid gait and was about
to pass the limping figure when a hand touched his
arm and looking down he found old Oscar by his
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;se sorry, Sah, I couldn&rsquo;t get out o&rsquo; your way,&rdquo;
he said apologetically. &ldquo;This hyar rheumatics am
mighty bad dis mawnin&rsquo;, Mister Rodgers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is too bad, Oscar.&rdquo; Rodgers, observing
the old man&rsquo;s weary air, spoke with impulsive sympathy.
&ldquo;You are pretty far from home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yessir. I started to do an errand fo&rsquo; Mandy,
and then I stopped to see a parade, an&rsquo; I jes&rsquo; naturally
has ter follow a band, an&rsquo; hyar I be!&rdquo; The old
darky heaved a heavy sigh. &ldquo;I &rsquo;spects a street cyar&rsquo;ll
be along bimeby an&rsquo; carry me over to Georgetown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get in my car and I will take you to &lsquo;Rose Hill.&rsquo;&rdquo;
At Rodgers&rsquo; suggestion a pleased smile lighted
Oscar&rsquo;s face and he showed his big white teeth to
their fullest extent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed, Sah, that&rsquo;s mighty nice ob you&rsquo;,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
moving with greater speed to the curb. &ldquo;I
kin get in, thank yo&rsquo; kindly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took Oscar a few minutes to get comfortably
settled in the roadster, and it was with a sigh of
genuine satisfaction that he leaned back and watched
Rodgers start his engine. His smile, which had
never quite departed since Rogers first suggested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>taking him home, broadened expansively as they
slipped through traffic and swung into a quieter side
street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; certainly kin drive, Mister Rodgers,&rdquo; he
said, breaking the long silence. &ldquo;I guess yo&rsquo; can
beat Major Wallace handlin&rsquo; a cyar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the compliment, Oscar,&rdquo; Rodgers
laughed. &ldquo;Major Wallace has a reputation as a
speedster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yessir,&rdquo; but Oscar looked a trifle bewildered,
long words were not his strong point. &ldquo;Major
Wallace done taught Miss Kitty ter drive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, has he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yessir.&rdquo; Oscar was oblivious of Rodgers&rsquo; shortness
of tone. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; the things Ole Miss cut
up ructions &rsquo;bout. She did hate dat Major, an&rsquo; she
jes&rsquo; laid Miss Kitty out fo&rsquo; goin&rsquo; wid him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, Oscar, Miss Susan did not hate Major
Wallace,&rdquo; objected Rodgers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did, Sah, she did.&rdquo; Oscar&rsquo;s smile had disappeared
and he spoke quickly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; she suttenly
did &rsquo;spress her mind to Miss Kitty on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers turned and scanned Oscar closely. The
old darky looked the picture of honest respectability.
His worn clothes were neatly brushed and patched.
He sat with his battered hat cocked a trifle over one
eye and his black face shone with the enjoyment of
the unexpected treat of a ride in a fast roadster with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>&ldquo;one of the quality&rdquo; as he termed Ted Rodgers in
his own mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you tell Coroner Penfield that Miss
Susan and her niece quarreled on Sunday?&rdquo; Rodgers
asked. The old man blinked at the unexpected
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause he axed me, an&rsquo; they did quarrel.&rdquo;
Oscar&rsquo;s voice betrayed a strain of obstinacy.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no harm tellin&rsquo; de truf, is there, Mister
Rodgers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, certainly not.&rdquo; Rodgers slowed down at a
street crossing and in shifting gears failed to catch
the sudden crafty look Oscar shot at him. It vanished
in a second. &ldquo;How is Miss Kitty this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tol&rsquo;able well, thank yo&rsquo;,&rdquo; Oscar replied. &ldquo;Dr.
McLean was over las&rsquo; night an&rsquo; he tole Mandy that
he wanted Miss Kitty to leave town fo&rsquo; a month;
seemed to think she needed change. But Miss Kitty,
she said &lsquo;no.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she is not going away.&rdquo; Rodgers&rsquo; satisfaction
was unconcealed. &ldquo;Is she at home, Oscar?&rdquo;
as he slowed up the car before the entrance to &ldquo;Rose
Hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oscar shook his head. &ldquo;No, Sah, she done gone
fo&rsquo; de day,&rdquo; he said, opening the door and clambering
with some difficulty to the pavement. &ldquo;Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>Kitty said somethin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout seein&rsquo; Mrs. Parsons. She
done call her up dis mawnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought Miss Kitty had resigned from her
secretary work.&rdquo; Rodgers let his engine run and
leaned over to speak to Oscar. &ldquo;Has Mrs. Parsons
been here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sah, not since Miss Susan&rsquo;s death.&rdquo; Oscar
hesitated, looked up and down the empty street, then
back over his shoulder. No one was within earshot.
The old man took his hand from the car door and
rested his weight on his cane. &ldquo;I kinda &rsquo;spects they
had a fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;?&rdquo; Rodgers eyed him in deep surprise.
&ldquo;Miss Kitty and Mrs. Parsons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sah. Mrs. Parsons an&rsquo; ole Miss Susan.
Good mawnin&rsquo;, Sah,&rdquo; and Oscar stamped up the
steps leading to &ldquo;Rose Hill,&rdquo; deaf to Rodgers&rsquo; repeated
calls to return.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">ed Rodgers</span> shut off his engine, sprang
from the car and in ten strides had gained
the old negro&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a moment!&rdquo; And at the stern command
in his voice Oscar halted. &ldquo;I am convinced that you
know more of Miss Susan Baird&rsquo;s death than you
have admitted, Oscar, and&mdash;&rdquo; his voice deepened,
&ldquo;you are going to tell me the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oscar cast a frightened glance upward. Rodgers&rsquo;
determined expression was not one to encourage
evasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suttenly, Sah, suttenly. Wha-what truf do yo&rsquo;
wish, Sah?&rdquo; he stammered, politeness uppermost in
spite of his confusion of mind.</p>

<p>Rodgers&rsquo; gaze grew in intensity as he studied the
old man. The latter&rsquo;s eyes had shifted from his interrogator
to the mansion and his black face had
become mottled grey in color. As the silence
lengthened, Oscar&rsquo;s apprehension increased and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>fingers fumbled nervously with his cane. For the
life of him he could think of nothing to say. The
sound of Rodgers&rsquo; voice came as so vast a relief that
at first he failed to take in what he was saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You testified at the inquest, Oscar,&rdquo; Rodgers
stated slowly, &ldquo;that after serving a midday dinner
on Sunday you left &lsquo;Rose Hill.&rsquo; But you did not
tell Coroner Penfield that you returned here on Sunday
night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, Sah&mdash;fo&rsquo; Gawd, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Oscar raised
a trembling hand. &ldquo;I only jes&rsquo; passed along the
street down yonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did you see?&rdquo; demanded Rodgers, his
eyes sparkling. His chance shot in the dark had
told.</p>

<p>Oscar&rsquo;s answer was slow in coming. Moving
closer to Rodgers, he laid one shaking hand, knotted
from rheumatism, on his shoulder. The gesture,
half involuntary, held something pathetic in its mute
appeal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Massa,&rdquo; he began, and his voice grew wistful.
&ldquo;Whose side is yo&rsquo; on? Is yo&rsquo; fo&rsquo; de police o&rsquo; fo&rsquo;
Miss Kitty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers whitened as he met the old man&rsquo;s direct
gaze. At last there was no shifting in Oscar&rsquo;s eyes.
Man to man they faced each other&mdash;master and
servant&mdash;each dominated with one desire: to serve
one woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I would give my life for Miss Kitty,&rdquo; Rodgers&rsquo;
deep voice carried conviction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; yo&rsquo; won&rsquo;t let no harm come to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The reply rang out clearly. Oscar&rsquo;s harassed
expression altered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gawd bless yo&rsquo;, Sah!&rdquo; He touched Rogers&rsquo;
hand reverently. &ldquo;Ole Mandy an&rsquo; me, we&rsquo;s needed
help de worst way. Hadn&rsquo;t nowhar to turn; now&mdash;&rdquo;
he drew a long breath of relief. &ldquo;Now yo&rsquo; kin find
Miss Kitty&rsquo;s red coat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Kitty&rsquo;s red coat?&rdquo; echoed Rodgers, staring
in astonishment at Oscar. &ldquo;What in the world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yessir.&rdquo; Oscar blinked rapidly. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; &rsquo;member
dat dar coat Miss Kitty was so fond o&rsquo; wearin&rsquo;?&mdash;I
heard yo&rsquo; an&rsquo; she argyfying &rsquo;bout it bein&rsquo; pink &rsquo;stead
o&rsquo; red.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the one you mean,&rdquo; replied Rodgers impatiently.
&ldquo;Well, what about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done gone!&rdquo; Oscar raised his hand and
dropped it in a gesture indicative of despair. &ldquo;An&rsquo;,
Mister Rodgers, we&rsquo;s got ter find dat ar coat fo&rsquo; de
police.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers stared at him for a full moment. There
was no doubting Oscar&rsquo;s sincerity. His face was
beaded in perspiration and his eyes, twice their normal
size, were alight with earnest appeal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Sah, don&rsquo;t ax me no mo&rsquo; questions,&rdquo; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>pleaded. &ldquo;Jes&rsquo; find dat coat an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll know who
killed ole Miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; Rodgers shook a bewildered
head. &ldquo;What are you driving at, Oscar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find dat coat, Sah, an&rsquo; then yo&rsquo;ll know all.
&rsquo;Deed, Massa, I ain&rsquo;t lyin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Oscar&rsquo;s voice shook
with feeling. &ldquo;Please, Sah, do as I ax. It&rsquo;s fo&rsquo;
Miss Kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Rodgers came to a sudden decision.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best to aid Miss Kitty, even if I
do it blindfolded. But, see here, Oscar, wouldn&rsquo;t it
be simpler to ask Miss Kitty for her coat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She mustn&rsquo;t know nawthin&rsquo;!&rdquo; Oscar spoke in
genuine alarm. &ldquo;She&mdash;she ain&rsquo;t had it fo&rsquo; mos&rsquo; some
time&mdash;&rdquo; His lips trembled a bit and he touched them
with the tips of his fingers. &ldquo;The coat ain&rsquo;t with
none o&rsquo; her clothes, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;se searched the house,
Massa, an&rsquo; Miss Kitty&rsquo;ll be everlastin&rsquo; grateful to
yo&rsquo;. But&mdash;&rdquo; his voice dropped to a husky whisper&mdash;&ldquo;yo&rsquo;
git it befo&rsquo; de police does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Engrossed in their conversation, Rodgers had
failed to note that Oscar had gradually edged his
way to the top step. With an agility which took
Rodgers completely by surprise the old negro whisked
down the walk which skirted the mansion and disappeared
from sight.</p>

<p>With an oath Rodgers pursued him down the
walk, only to reach the side door and have it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>slammed in his face. Repeated knocking brought
no response, and after circling the mansion in the
hope of finding an entrance, if not a glimpse of
Oscar, he finally returned to his car and started for
Washington much perturbed in mind.</p>

<p>On reaching Washington, Rodgers ran the car
toward Pennsylvania Avenue, stopping en route to
purchase a can of Mobiloil. It did not take him long
to drive to a garage in an alley to the south of the
Avenue. At his hail the owner of the small shop
came out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;dy, Mr. Rodgers,&rdquo; he exclaimed, touching
his soiled cap. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the car going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, but I want the oil drained out, Sam,&rdquo;
handing, as he spoke, the can of Mobiloil to the mechanic.
&ldquo;How is business?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so so.&rdquo; Sam glanced about the wide alley.
&ldquo;Pull up to this side, Sir; I can get at the car better
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving the car, after he had complied with Sam&rsquo;s
request, Rodgers stood watching him for a few
minutes, but his thought would stray back to Kitty
Baird and he lost interest in both the car and the
mechanic. Lighting a cigarette, he strolled down
the alley to where it opened into Pennsylvania Avenue.
The sight of hurrying pedestrians and swift-moving
vehicles proved only a brief diversion as his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>mind again returned to Kitty and the unsolved problem
of her aunt&rsquo;s mysterious death.</p>

<p>Oscar&rsquo;s conduct was a puzzle which he wanted
time to think out. That the old man knew more of
the circumstances of Miss Susan Baird&rsquo;s death than
he was willing to divulge was self-evident. Rodgers
was thoroughly convinced that Oscar was devoted
to Kitty. What then, did he mean to infer by saying
that he, Rodgers, must find Kitty&rsquo;s red coat before
the police secured it? In what possible way
was the coat connected with Miss Baird&rsquo;s death?</p>

<p>The blare of a motor horn almost in his ear caused
Rodgers to jump to one side as an army truck drove
out of the valley and turned into Pennsylvania
Avenue. Not having time to look where he was
going, Rodgers collided with a dummy figure placed
in front of a second-hand clothes store. As Rodgers
picked up the figure he found that its wax face had
come in contact with the pavement and was decidedly
damaged. With an impatient sigh he entered
the store and was met by the proprietor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knocked over your dummy,&rdquo; he explained,
drawing out his leather wallet. &ldquo;It got a bit damaged.
How much&mdash;?&rdquo; and he opened a roll of
Treasury bills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait; I&rsquo;ll go see the dummy first,&rdquo; and the
proprietor bustled out of the shop.</p>

<p>As Rodgers turned to accompany him, his eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>fell upon a red coat lying on the counter. He had
the faculty of carrying a color in his mind&rsquo;s eye, also
of noticing minute details. The coat looked like
Kitty&rsquo;s&mdash;with a single stride he was at the counter&mdash;the
coat <i>was</i> Kitty&rsquo;s. It was a stylishly cut garment,
of a rough finish cloth, with large patch pockets and
a scarflike collar with fringe on the ends. To make
assurance doubly sure Rodgers examined the black
and gold buttons of Japanese handiwork. He had
admired them too often to be mistaken. How came
Kitty&rsquo;s coat in that store? A voice at his elbow
caused him to wheel about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The face is kinda mussed up,&rdquo; announced the
proprietor. &ldquo;Five dollars will cover it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five dollars!&rdquo; fumed Rodgers, then paused.
&ldquo;Oh, all right&mdash;&rdquo; handing him the money. &ldquo;How
much is this coat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty dollars.&rdquo; The proprietor had caught
sight of Rodgers&rsquo; generous roll of greenbacks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a nice coat; good as new, &rsquo;cept for the torn lining
and a few faded spots. It&rsquo;s just what any lady would
want. She could reline&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; cut in Rodgers and the proprietor
accepted his money with a wry face. Why had he
not asked more? It was not often that so biddable a
purchaser wandered into his shop. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo;
Rodgers paused in the doorway. &ldquo;How long have
you had this coat?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Two&mdash;no, three days.&rdquo; The proprietor paused
to consider. &ldquo;The woman came early in the morning
and somehow the coat got misplaced in my stock. I
was putting it in the window on display just as you
arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was the woman known to you?&rdquo; asked Rogers.
Both men were on the sidewalk by that time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not she&mdash;never laid eyes on her before and
wouldn&rsquo;t know her again if I was to see her.&rdquo; The
proprietor was in a happy mood; not often had he
taken in twenty-five dollars so easily. &ldquo;Well, I
hope your lady likes the coat. So-long,&rdquo; and he
nodded affably, as Rodgers turned into the alley.</p>

<p>There was still five minutes&rsquo; work to be done on
the car and Rodgers spent them in hurrying Sam
into completing the job without further waste of
time, and it was with a feeling of satisfaction that
he laid the coat on the seat and took his place behind
the steering wheel. He had to slow up for traffic
as he started out of the alley into Pennsylvania
Avenue. A hail close at hand caused him to look
around and he recognized the proprietor of the second-hand
clothes store approaching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! Just a minute,&rdquo; called the latter, and
Rodgers pulled up at the curb and waited for him.
&ldquo;Say, mister, my wife fancies that coat, so if you
don&rsquo;t mind I&rsquo;ll return you the twenty dollars,&rdquo; and
he held out the money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodgers eyed him in astonishment. &ldquo;I prefer to
keep the coat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sorry I can&rsquo;t oblige you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, see here,&rdquo; the man protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you
two extra dollars. Come now, that&rsquo;s fair; twenty-two
dollars. Money don&rsquo;t often turn over in your
plans quite so fast, does it?&rdquo; with a faint leer.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;re the extra dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I don&rsquo;t want them,&rdquo; dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The proprietor looked blank. &ldquo;&rsquo;Spose
we make it twenty-five?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about thirty dollars?&rdquo; persisted the man.
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m no piker,&rdquo; observing Rodgers&rsquo; expression.
&ldquo;When I want a thing I am willing to pay for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And just why do you want this coat so particularly?&rdquo;
asked Rodgers, his suspicion aroused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you my wife wants that coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she can&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo; Rodgers released the
clutch and the car shot down the Avenue, leaving
the dealer in second-hand clothes standing with
mouth agape, gesticulating wildly after him.</p>

<p>It was but a short distance to the Bachelor where
he had an apartment, and Rodgers paid small regard
to traffic regulations until he reached there.
He wasted some valuable moments in finding parking
space near the building and he was in no amiable
frame of mind when he finally hurried through
the swing door of the front entrance. The elevator
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>boy was nowhere visible and Rodgers collected his
letters from his mail box; then, tucking the red coat
under his arm, he went over to the staircase and
mounted it two steps at a time until he reached the
third floor. As he turned his latch-key and threw
open the door of his apartment he heard his name
called and whirled around. Ben Potter was walking
toward him from the direction of the elevator
shaft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad I caught you, Ted,&rdquo; he remarked, ignoring
Rodgers&rsquo; curt manner. Not waiting for an invitation,
he stepped into the apartment and walked
through the short hall into the large room which
served Rodgers as a combination living and dining
room. &ldquo;I came to apologize for my surly behavior
in Craige&rsquo;s office this morning, old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your apology is due to Miss Baird rather than
to me,&rdquo; replied Rodgers stiffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I spoke in haste&mdash;without thought,&rdquo; Potter admitted
amiably. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drop the matter, Ted. Can
you dine with us to-night? I&rsquo;ll get Kitty to come
also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an engagement to-night, thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter&rsquo;s florid complexion turned a warmer tint
and he averted his gaze so that Rodgers might not
detect the sudden rage which his eyes betrayed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry; but you&rsquo;ll come some other time, per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>haps,&rdquo;
he mumbled. &ldquo;Nina&rsquo;s greatly interested in
hearing of all that you have done for Kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;done for her?&rdquo; Rodgers turned and eyed his
companion sharply. Potter had perched himself on
the end of the lounge with the evident intention of
remaining, and was leisurely rolling a cigarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;you have accomplished a great deal for
Kitty,&rdquo; Potter affirmed with emphasis. &ldquo;You found
the will which gave her a fortune. To put it poetically,
the beggar maid is now an heiress and a prey
to fortune hunters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers&rsquo; eyes blazed. &ldquo;Your remarks are offensive,&rdquo;
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Potter straightened up. &ldquo;Are you trying to fasten
a quarrel on me?&rdquo; he demanded hotly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to make you speak more respectfully of
Miss Baird,&rdquo; retorted Rodgers, his anger at white
heat. &ldquo;If that means a fight&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; and
he tossed the red coat on the nearest chair to have
his hands free.</p>

<p>Potter&rsquo;s big frame relaxed against the cushioned
back of the lounge as he forced a laugh. &ldquo;You are
too damned quick to take offense,&rdquo; he protested.
&ldquo;Why, Kitty&rsquo;s my cousin. I&rsquo;d be the first to take
her part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you insinuate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; with a patience meant to exasperate.
&ldquo;What are you doing with Kitty&rsquo;s red coat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers met the unexpected question with unmoved
countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is not Miss
Baird&rsquo;s coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Potter&rsquo;s rising inflection expressed
doubt. &ldquo;Let me see it?&rdquo; And he reached forward
a grasping hand.</p>

<p>With a quick movement Rodgers pulled the coat
beyond Potter&rsquo;s reach. The next second he was
staggering backward from a crashing blow delivered
as Potter, who had gathered himself for a spring,
swung forward upon his feet. Rage at the treacherous
attack was a stimulant to Rodgers and he
met Potter&rsquo;s second onslaught with a swift right-hander.
The scientist was no easy antagonist and
for the moment he had the better of the rough and
tumble fight; then as the younger man got his second
wind he gave back and Rodgers pinned him
against the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You yellow dog!&rdquo; Rodgers half sobbed the
words in his rage as he shifted his grip to the man&rsquo;s
throat.</p>

<p>The movement gave Potter his opportunity.
Wrenching his right hand free he jerked a revolver
from his coat pocket and brought the butt against
Rodgers&rsquo; temple with stunning force. Rodgers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>sagged backward, then regained his balance as Potter&rsquo;s
revolver again descended on his head. With
a low moan he sank back, overturning a chair in his
fall.</p>

<p>As Potter bent over the half-conscious man a resounding
knock at the apartment door caused him
to start upright. One hasty glance about the room
showed him that the window overlooking the fire-escape
was open. Potter&rsquo;s eyes sought the red coat.
It lay on the floor, half hidden under Rodgers.
Stooping over, he seized one of the sleeves and
tugged at it.</p>

<p>The action aroused Rodgers from his stupor and
with such strength as remained he grasped the
sleeve also. It was an unequal tug-of-war. Potter&rsquo;s
cry of triumph was drowned by repeated
knocking on the door and the sound of raised voices
demanding admittance. Not daring to remain
longer, he released his hold on the coat sleeve and
bolted through the window and down the fire-escape
as an agile elevator boy climbed through the pantry
window from an adjoining balcony and popped into
the living room. He stopped aghast at sight of
Rodgers, torn and bleeding, and the chaotic condition
of the overturned furniture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lawd! What&rsquo;s been a-happenin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he
gasped. &ldquo;We heered ructions an&rsquo; I got de police.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Police!&rdquo; The last word penetrated Rodgers&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>reeling senses, and his eyes sought the red coat
sleeve which he still grasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; they&rsquo;re at the do&rsquo; now,&rdquo; as renewed pounding
echoed through the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go and let them in,&rdquo; commanded Rodgers; then,
as the boy dashed down the hall, he staggered to his
feet over to the small dumb-waiter shaft which
was used to carry garbage cans, milk bottles and
packages to the apartment. But one idea was uppermost&mdash;the
police must not get Kitty&rsquo;s red coat. He
had just time to open the door and thrust the red
coat down the chute and close the door again before
two policemen appeared in the room. Stars were
dancing before Rodgers&rsquo; eyes and he brushed his
hand across his forehead. He must think&mdash;think&mdash; Should
he have Potter arrested? No, he would
settle the score between them without police aid. His
hands clenched at the thought and he straightened
up in spite of the increasing sense of faintness which
caused his knees to sag under him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; demanded the foremost policeman.
&ldquo;Who attacked you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A burglar, evidently,&rdquo; replied Rodgers, sinking
down in the nearest chair. &ldquo;I walked in on him.
He went that way&mdash;&rdquo; indicating the fire-escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chase down and see if you can catch him,
Mike,&rdquo; ordered the first speaker. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll search the
apartment for any clues. Here&mdash;&rdquo; observing Rodg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>ers&rsquo;
half-fainting condition&mdash;&ldquo;Good Lord, he&rsquo;s
keeled over!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An hour later Rodgers, his cuts treated by Dr.
McLean, and finally left alone by a too-solicitous
policeman, went down into the basement of the
apartment house. He had no difficulty in locating
the opening to the dumb-waiter shaft. Looking inside,
he found it empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Mr. Rodgers?&rdquo; inquired the janitor&rsquo;s
wife, a young colored girl who acted as laundress for
the tenants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a red coat which I accidentally
dropped down the chute, Cora,&rdquo; Rodgers explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy, Sir, I wish I&rsquo;d known that was yours,&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;It was on top of a pile of trash
and was so raggety that I just put the whole business
in the furnace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers stared at her aghast, then, collecting his
wits, he dashed by her and into the furnace room.
The light from a hot fire half blinded him as he
flung open the furnace door. Lying on the flagging
close to the opening was a portion of the red coat&mdash;the
rest was ashes. Rodgers jerked out the piece
of red cloth, and flinging it on the cement floor,
stamped out the smoldering flames. Paying no attention
to Cora&rsquo;s lamentations, he hurried upstairs,
the precious piece in his hand.</p>

<p>Once more in his apartment and with the door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>safely locked, he dropped down on the lounge and
regarded all that remained of the coat, as his
thoughts returned to Oscar and his fervid request
that he &ldquo;find Miss Kitty&rsquo;s red coat.&rdquo; In what way
was the red coat involved in the mystery of Miss
Baird&rsquo;s death? Why had the dealer in second-hand
clothes wished so ardently to buy it back? How
had it gotten into his hands in the first place? Above
all, why did Ben Potter wish to gain possession
of it?</p>

<p>Rodgers&rsquo; head swam with the effort to find an
answer to the enigma. Sinking back against the
cushions, he ran his hand over the piece of red
cloth. It was the front breadth of the coat and its
patch pocket that had remained intact.</p>

<p>As Rodgers&rsquo; fingers strayed inside the pocket his
thoughts turned to Kitty Baird&mdash;beautiful Kitty
Baird&mdash;his best beloved. His restless fingers closed
over a small wad of paper pressed deep in the coat
pocket. A second later he had smoothed out the
paper and, carrying it to the light, strove to read
the writing upon it. A whistle escaped him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An &lsquo;I.O.U.,&rsquo;&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Devil take it, the
signature&rsquo;s undecipherable!&rdquo;</p>

A WORD OF WARNING</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">K</span><span class="smcap">itty Baird</span> regarded the butler with
astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Parsons is not at home,&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;Why, Oscar brought me a telephone message
from her asking me to be here at noon and to
lunch with her.&rdquo; She consulted her watch. &ldquo;Are
you quite certain that she is not in, James?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite, Miss Kitty.&rdquo; The butler&rsquo;s solemnity of
manner matched his severe black clothes, which
fitted his somewhat spare form with the neatness
of a glove. &ldquo;Mrs. Parsons had forgotten a meeting
of the Neighborhood House Committee, and she
left word that she was very sorry to put you out.
She said that she had no idea what time she would
be back, and that you were not to wait for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The exclamation slipped from Kitty with
some vigor. &ldquo;Oh, very well, James,&rdquo; with a quick
change of tone. &ldquo;Please tell Mrs. Parsons that I
called. Good morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Miss Kitty.&rdquo; And James re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>treated
inside the vestibule and closed the front
door. As he went through the hallway, intent on
reaching the servants&rsquo; dining room by the shortest
possible route, he failed to see Mrs. Parsons standing
in the folds of the portières before the entrance
to the small reception room, which, with the large
dining room, was on the ground floor of her English
basement house.</p>

<p>From her vantage point, Mrs. Parsons had overheard
Kitty&rsquo;s conversation with her butler. Slipping
her front door key, with which she had gained
entrance some moments before, unknown to James,
into her gold mesh bag, she hurried to the small
window which overlooked the street. Taking care
not to be seen by passers-by, Mrs. Parsons watched
Kitty standing by the curb, apparently in doubt as
to whether to cross the street or not.</p>

<p>Kitty, in fact, was debating where she should
lunch. Time hung heavy on her hands, and the
thought of the great empty house in Georgetown
sent a shiver down her spine. Neither Mandy nor
Oscar were enlivening company at the best of times,
and since her aunt&rsquo;s death&mdash;Kitty shivered again.
Oscar&rsquo;s morbid relish of everything pertaining to
the tragedy, his incessant harping on the subject,
had worked upon Kitty&rsquo;s nerves, and except for
her appreciation of his many years of devoted ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>vice,
she would have paid him several months&rsquo;
wages in advance and let him go.</p>

<p>Mandy, since the day of the discovery of Miss
Susan Baird&rsquo;s dead body, had moved over to &ldquo;Rose
Hill,&rdquo; bag and baggage, and Kitty had been grateful
for her watchful care. Unlike her husband,
Mandy was not given to talking and she had seen
to it that Kitty had every attention, and in her way
had done much to shelter her from inquisitive callers.
Mandy looked upon the telephone as the invention
of the Evil One, and nothing would induce her
to answer it, so that to Oscar had fallen the task
of keeping reporters away. His loquaciousness had,
however, been checked by a stringent command
from Mr. Craige to refer all newspaper men to him
or to the police. The order had been emphasized
with a hint that, if not carried out, Oscar would be
parted from what promised to be a lucrative pension.
Oscar had obeyed the order with much
grumbling, but his complaints were carefully confided
to his wife alone and fell on unsympathetic
ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go &rsquo;long, nigger; don&rsquo;t bother yo&rsquo; betters,&rdquo; she
had responded. &ldquo;Ef yo&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t careful, Miss Kitty&rsquo;ll
bounce us both. An&rsquo; then whar&rsquo;ll we be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty looked at her watch again. She had ample
time to walk down to the Allies&rsquo; Inn for luncheon
and she would feel better for the exercise. Already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>the sunshine and fresh air had braced her up. Her
decision made, she waved away a taxi-driver hovering
near the curb with a watchful eye on her, and,
turning, started down the street. She was conscious
of a man passing her at a rapid walk, but with her
head slightly bent and her thoughts elsewhere, she
did not glance up. The man ran up the three steps
leading to Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; front door, stopped,
turned around and looked at her. The next second
Kitty heard her name called by a familiar voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What luck!&rdquo; exclaimed Leigh Wallace, as she
waited for him to approach. &ldquo;Where are you going,
Kitty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the Allies&rsquo; Inn for luncheon,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;Mrs. Parsons is out, Leigh; I&rsquo;ve just been there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ah!&rdquo; Wallace twirled his swagger stick
with such energy that it almost slipped from his
grasp. &ldquo;In that case, Kitty, lunch with me at the
Shoreham? Don&rsquo;t say you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; as she shook her
head. &ldquo;I must talk to you&mdash;by yourself. Don&rsquo;t
refuse, Kitty, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty looked at him steadily. &ldquo;We can talk as
we walk along,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; And
her decided tone left Wallace nothing to do but
match his footstep to hers as she sauntered along.</p>

<p>From her sheltered nook in the window Mrs.
Parsons saw Major Wallace&rsquo;s rapid approach to her
front door, observed his belated recognition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>Kitty, heard his hail, and watched their leisurely
walk down the street. An odd smile crossed her
lips as she dropped the window curtain into place
and went quietly to her bedroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Francise,&rdquo; she said, as her confidential maid
rose on her entrance and laid down some sewing,
&ldquo;tell James that I will lunch alone to-day. Major
Wallace is unexpectedly detained and has cancelled
his engagement with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty found Major Wallace a taciturn companion,
and her efforts at conversation elicited only
absent-minded, monosyllabic replies as they walked
slowly down Connecticut Avenue. It was not until
they reached H Street that Wallace awoke from his
abstraction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Shoreham is down this way,&rdquo; he expostulated
as Kitty continued walking straight ahead.
&ldquo;You must lunch with me, Kitty, you promised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did nothing of the sort,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;You
said that you wished to talk to me and you have
had every opportunity to do so. Instead of which
you have been silent to the verge of rudeness.
Frankly,&rdquo; and her voice was decidedly chilly, &ldquo;you
owe me an explanation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just it,&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;Why have you
avoided me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? Avoided you?&rdquo; The scorn in Kitty&rsquo;s voice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>caused him to color warmly. &ldquo;I have done nothing
of the sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sent word that you &lsquo;begged to be excused&rsquo;
when I called to see you,&rdquo; Wallace reminded her
bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The words were of Oscar&rsquo;s choosing, not mine,&rdquo;
she explained. &ldquo;You came the night of the inquest,
and by Dr. McLean&rsquo;s orders I denied myself to all
callers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you saw Ted Rodgers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; Her color deepened, but her
eyes did not fall before his angry gaze. &ldquo;It is not
your right to dictate to me about anything. And
besides,&rdquo; not giving him a chance to interrupt her,
&ldquo;you have had ample time to call since then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been ill&mdash;oh, hang it!&rdquo; as a hurrying pedestrian
collided against him. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk here.
There&rsquo;s no fun in being jostled about by idiots!&rdquo;&mdash;casting
a vindictive glance at the offender, who had
just made the street car he had been running to
catch.</p>

<p>Kitty eyed Wallace sharply. Never before had
she known him so upset in speech and manner. As
she observed the careworn lines in his face and the
mute appeal in his deep-set eyes, her anger cooled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will lunch with you, Leigh,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But
why make such a point of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What answer Wallace would have made remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>unspoken, as a mutual acquaintance swooped down
upon them and, utterly ignoring their lack of cordiality,
insisted upon accompanying them to the
Shoreham. Once inside the hotel restaurant, Wallace
lost no time in securing a table in a secluded
corner and an attentive waiter took his order for
luncheon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; and Wallace, with a sigh
of satisfaction, laid down the menu card and contemplated
Kitty with admiration but thinly veiled.
Her mourning was extremely becoming to her
blonde beauty. &ldquo;Is this story true that I hear, Kitty,
that your aunt has left you a fortune?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty considered him in silence. The question
had been asked so often by friends and acquaintances
that it had lost its novelty; coming from him
it surprised her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craige assures me that I am no longer a
pauper,&rdquo; she answered, and her tone was dry.</p>

<p>Wallace flushed. &ldquo;The papers said that you were
wealthy, very wealthy,&rdquo; he persisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It depends on how you compute wealth,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;And how much faith you put in newspapers.&rdquo;
A faint mocking smile touched her lips
and vanished. &ldquo;Why this interest in my fortune,
Leigh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he spoke with unconcealed bitterness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>&ldquo;it puts another barrier between us. Your aunt&rsquo;s
hatred, and now this, this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please stop,&rdquo; Kitty raised her hand slightly.
&ldquo;Why keep up the farce longer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farce?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flirtation, if you like it better,&rdquo; she sighed involuntarily.
&ldquo;Just an idle flirtation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Idle nothing! You&rsquo;d have married me if you
hadn&rsquo;t met Ted Rodgers,&rdquo; he blurted out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Her tone, though low, was imperative.
&ldquo;Here is luncheon. Suppose we discuss another
topic. When does Nina Potter return from New
York?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; shortly. &ldquo;Have a muffin, do?&rdquo;
and he extended the bread plate toward her, then
relapsed into abstracted silence.</p>

<p>Kitty&rsquo;s healthy young appetite, sharpened by her
walk, did full justice to the luncheon, and, not feeling
inclined for conversation, she was content to
watch the groups of people seated at near-by tables.
One pair, obviously a bride and groom, especially
attracted her and she turned for another look at
them as they left the restaurant. When she faced
around toward Wallace again, she saw their waiter
slip a note into his hand. It was deftly done and
only Kitty&rsquo;s keen eyes detected the act. Wallace, his
face devoid of expression, laid the lunch check and
a bank note on the silver salver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind the change,&rdquo; he said to the waiter,
and rising helped Kitty put on her coat and adjust
her furs. &ldquo;I am sorry my car is in the paint shop,
but we will get a taxi at the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; objected Kitty.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t propose to put you to all that trouble,
Leigh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without answering, Wallace led the way down
the corridor to the H Street entrance. &ldquo;Call a taxi,&rdquo;
he directed the doorman, then turned to Kitty.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scold,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I am going to Fort
Myer and it will not take me out of my way to
leave you at &lsquo;Rose Hill.&rsquo; Here&rsquo;s the car&mdash;&rdquo; and
before Kitty could protest further, she was bundled
inside the taxi. Wallace gave a few hurried directions
to the chauffeur and then sprang in beside her.</p>

<p>The chauffeur was evidently a novice for he
started his car with such a jerk that Kitty was half
thrown from her seat. With a muttered word
which strongly resembled a curse, Wallace picked up
her bag and muff and laid them in her lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &mdash;&mdash; fool!&rdquo; His face was red with anger.
&ldquo;Sorry, Kitty, I have no use for incompetents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty watched him in wondering silence. In place
of a sunny temperament she found uncontrolled
irritability; instead of the steady gaze she was
familiar with, she became aware of ever shifting
eyes. What had changed her cheery companion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>the past into the nervous, unhappy man by her side?</p>

<p>Kitty sighed involuntarily. She had met Leigh
Wallace four months before, shortly after he was
admitted as a patient at Walter Reed Hospital, at a
&ldquo;birthday party&rdquo; for the Walter Reed boys at the
Theodorus Bailey Myers Mason House, and they
had become great friends. Her aunt&rsquo;s dislike was
so general, so far as her friends were concerned,
that Kitty had not taken seriously her objections to
the gay and handsome army officer. When she finally
realized that Miss Susan Baird had conceived
what appeared to be an actual hatred of Leigh Wallace,
Kitty had tried to reason with her, but to no
avail. When Miss Susan Baird had once acquired
an idea, the Rock of Gibraltar was as jelly to her.</p>

<p>Kitty had inherited some of the Baird obstinacy,
and it was that trait more than anything else which
had fanned her liking into a violent flirtation with
Wallace. She considered her aunt unjust in her
treatment of him and resented her incivility. Her
sympathies aroused, she had almost persuaded herself
that she was in love with him, and then&mdash;Kitty&rsquo;s
face flamed at the recollection. Then she
had met Edward Rodgers.</p>

<p>Time had had no place in the development of
their friendship. He had been drawn to her with
the same irresistible attraction which the North Pole
has for the magnetic needle. No word of love had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>ever passed his lips, but his eyes&mdash;they had pleaded
his suit more eloquently than any words.</p>

<p>Absorbed in her thoughts, Kitty was actually
startled when the taxi stopped in front of &ldquo;Rose
Hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo; she asked, as Wallace
helped her out of the car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks, I haven&rsquo;t time.&rdquo; Wallace looked up
at the fine old mansion and hesitated a moment.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and get in to-night or to-morrow. Say,
Kitty, why don&rsquo;t you go to a hotel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s astonishment was obvious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Close up your house,&rdquo; with hurried emphasis.
&ldquo;You ought not to live there alone. What is Craige
thinking of to let you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am not alone,&rdquo; she pointed out. &ldquo;Oscar
and Mandy are living with me now. Besides&mdash;&rdquo;
it was her turn to hesitate. &ldquo;The police wish the
house kept open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do, eh?&rdquo; Wallace turned and scowled at
the mansion. &ldquo;Have you heard anything, Kitty&mdash;any
new theories about your aunt&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;I only know those published
in the newspapers,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;The
police do not make a confidante of me. Won&rsquo;t you
change your mind, Leigh, and come into the
house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Wallace walked with her up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>terraced steps to the front door and laid an impatient
hand on the old-fashioned bell-pull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ring!&rdquo; exclaimed Kitty. &ldquo;Both of the servants
are out. I have my latch-key to the side door.
Don&rsquo;t wait any longer, Leigh, if you are in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure you can get in?&rdquo; Kitty nodded an affirmative.
Wallace wavered a moment, glanced at the
bunch of keys which Kitty produced from her muff,
then cast a fleeting look at the walk which skirted
the mansion. &ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; he stepped closer to her side,
his hands fumbling awkwardly with his hat. &ldquo;Did
you and your aunt really quarrel about me on Sunday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty stepped back as if shot. &ldquo;What an egotistical
question?&rdquo; she stammered, with a brave attempt
at a laugh. &ldquo;On the contrary, Leigh, Aunt Susan
and I had words over a matter of no importance; as
was our habit. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by&mdash;&rdquo; Wallace echoed her words mechanically,
and, without a further glance at her, ran down
the steps.</p>

<p>Kitty watched the taxi and its solitary passenger
disappear up Q Street before turning toward the
brick walk which circled the house and led to the
large garden in the rear. She dreaded entering the
house alone. It was a feeling which she had not
been able to conquer, and she had, on the few occasions
when she had gone out, always arranged to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>have one of the servants in the house upon her
return. Mandy had asked for the afternoon off and
Oscar, not being at home when Kitty left to go to
Mrs. Parsons, had probably not gotten back in time
to be told by Mandy before her departure that he
was to await Kitty&rsquo;s return.</p>

<p>Kitty shook herself. It was not yet four o&rsquo;clock
in the afternoon. It was foolish to give way to
nerves. But before turning into the walk, Kitty
took one final look down the terraced steps, hoping
for a sight of Mandy&rsquo;s substantial form or old
Oscar&rsquo;s halting walk. Neither was visible. As her
glance swept upward, she saw a piece of crumpled
paper lying on the step just below her. Stooping
over, she picked it up and, observing writing upon it,
smoothed out the paper. She had read the few
words it bore several times before she took in their
meaning.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">Leigh, you are watched.</p>

<p>Kitty turned the paper over. It was the one she
had seen the waiter at the Shoreham slip surreptitiously
into Leigh Wallace&rsquo;s hand. She recognized
the delicate mauve shade of the paper&mdash;she also recognized
the handwriting. Why had Mrs. Parsons
written such a warning to Leigh Wallace?</p>

<p>With her ideas in a whirl Kitty walked slowly
around the mansion and to the side door. It gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>entrance to the library. There was a perceptible
pause before Kitty unlocked the door and entered
the house. She had grown to loathe the library.</p>

<p>Mouchette, aroused from her slumber in front of
the fireplace, came forward with many &ldquo;mews&rdquo; to
greet her. Kitty fondled the cat affectionately before
laying down her muff and fur piece on the
nearest chair. Going over to the chimney, she poked
the smoldering embers on the hearth into a feeble
blaze and added some kindling wood.</p>

<p>She had a sense of chill in the room apart from
its lack of heat. She could not dissociate her surroundings
from the tragedy of Sunday. In her
mind&rsquo;s eye she saw always her aunt&rsquo;s body lying
inert in the throne-shaped chair and in memory she
conjured up their last interview on that fatal Sunday
afternoon. Her aunt had not spared her feelings.
What was it that she had called her&mdash;an ingrate!
And her last sentence still echoed in Kitty&rsquo;s ears:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mark my words, Kitty, if you don&rsquo;t conquer this
infatuation for Leigh Wallace, it will not be you
alone who will suffer. It will kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Kitty spread out her cold hands to the blaze
her eyes again read the message written by Mrs.
Parsons on the mauve-colored paper, which she still
clutched in her fingers:</p>

<p class="center no-indent">Leigh, you are watched.</p>

BRIBERY</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smcap"> resounding</span> knock on the side door,
through which she had entered the library
a few minutes before, caused Kitty to start
violently and her hand reached out instinctively to
catch the mantel-piece to steady herself. For a second
she rested her weight against it, then, controlling
her nervousness, she thrust the mauve paper into the
pocket of her coat and with reluctance moved over
to the side door. Callers did not usually announce
their presence in that manner. Miss Susan Baird
had never permitted what she termed &ldquo;familiarity,&rdquo;
and no friend, no matter what the degree of intimacy,
was ever admitted except through the front
door. Her dominating character had forced respect
for her peculiarities, and Kitty could recall no one,
except herself, who had ever cared to cross her aunt
in any particular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>With her hand on the door-knob, Kitty hesitated.
She was alone in the house and in no mood for
visitors. Squaring her shoulders, she pulled the
door partly open. Inspector Mitchell was standing
on the top step of the small &ldquo;stoop&rdquo; which led to
the brick walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Miss Baird,&rdquo; he said, bowing
affably. &ldquo;Can you spare me a few minutes of your
time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly.&rdquo; Kitty concealed her vexation.
The inspector was the last person she had expected
to encounter. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo; and she
opened the door to a wider extent. Not waiting for
him to remove his overcoat, she hurried across the
library and picking up a log from the wood basket
by the hearth she stirred the fire to a brighter blaze.
On facing about, she found the inspector standing
in front of the side door and regarding it with fixed
attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This door does not seem exactly in keeping with
this house,&rdquo; he said, as Kitty approached him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
never seen a finer example of Colonial architecture,
but this&mdash;&rdquo; laying his hand on the upper section of
the door&mdash;&ldquo;this resembles a Dutch door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is exactly what it is, or rather, what Aunt
Susan had it converted into,&rdquo; Kitty explained.
&ldquo;Aunt Susan had a bad attack of inflammatory
rheumatism about fifteen years ago; she could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>leave the house and sat chiefly in this room. She
was devoted to her garden and had this side door
cut in half so that she could see outside without
having to open the entire door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this panel in the upper half of the door?&rdquo;
Mitchell laid his hand on it as he spoke. &ldquo;Does it
open?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a sliding panel.&rdquo; Kitty stifled a yawn.
&ldquo;The builder&rsquo;s idea of ornamentation, I presume&mdash;a
door within a door.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;And rusty
with disuse. Oscar has an objection to cleaning
brass, or anything in fact that requires &lsquo;elbow
grease.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>latch</i> is discolored,&rdquo; Mitchell amended.
With a quick motion of his hand he released the
catch and pushed the panel backward. &ldquo;But there is
no sign of rust in the hinges. Judging from the way
this panel moves, Miss Baird, it is well oiled. See
for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty glanced at him in surprise before moving
the panel back and forth. Inspector Mitchell was
right; it moved with ease and totally without noise.
When pushed to the farthest, the panel left an opening
about eight inches square.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that, Miss Baird?&rdquo; inquired
Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s eyebrows drew
together in a perplexed frown. &ldquo;We never touched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>that panel; never had occasion to use it. This,&rdquo;
laying her hand on the upper part of the Dutch door,
&ldquo;we frequently kept open in the summer as we get
the southwestern breeze through it. We never use
this door as a means of exit except to go into the
garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You entered by it to-day upon your return,&rdquo;
Mitchell remarked and Kitty favored him with a
blank stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you watching me?&rdquo; she asked with a touch
of coldness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was waiting in the summer house,&rdquo; Mitchell
explained, ignoring her manner. &ldquo;No one answered
the front bell and, as I wished very much to see you,
I killed time by strolling through the garden. Then
you don&rsquo;t generally use this entrance to the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Kitty regarded him inquiringly, puzzled
by his persistent questions on a trivial subject.
&ldquo;Only since Aunt Susan&rsquo;s death. The lock on this
door is modern and the key a reasonable size to
carry in my hand bag. Perhaps you recall the key
to the front door?&rdquo; she could not restrain a smile.
&ldquo;It is old-fashioned&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell nodded. &ldquo;I recollect its size,&rdquo; he remarked
dryly. &ldquo;I found it in the key-hole of the
front door on Monday morning, just before we discovered
your aunt lying dead in this room. Haven&rsquo;t
any idea how the key got there then, have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Kitty turned pale. &ldquo;At the coroner&rsquo;s inquest I
told all that I know of the circumstances surrounding
my aunt&rsquo;s death.&rdquo; She faced him quickly. &ldquo;Have
<i>you</i> made no discoveries bearing on the crime?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only those brought out at the inquest,&rdquo; he replied,
with noncommittal brevity. &ldquo;Come, Miss
Baird, suppose we talk over some of the aspects of
the case. I won&rsquo;t detain you very long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking her consent for granted, Inspector Mitchell
wheeled forward an armchair and selected
another for himself. Mouchette watched them both,
then, rising stiffly, deserted her favorite spot near
the hearth and perched herself in Kitty&rsquo;s lap, her
loud purr testifying to her contentment as Kitty
passed her hands over the soft gray fur. Kitty did
not care to break the pause that followed. She was
content to remain silent and await developments.
Mitchell did not leave her long in doubt as to the
direction his thoughts were tending.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Craige tells me that you have inherited a
pretty fortune,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;A very pretty fortune,
to be exact. Now, your aunt, if you&rsquo;ll excuse my
directness, lived in, eh,&rdquo; he hesitated, &ldquo;say, genteel
poverty.&rdquo; Kitty nodded somberly. Would people
never stop harping on her suddenly acquired wealth?
&ldquo;Where did your aunt get this money she left to
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I am as ignorant
on the subject as you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell eyed her intently. Was it candor which
prompted the direct denial or duplicity? She appeared
unconscious of his steady gaze, her attention
apparently centered on the flickering fire, and her
hands, clasped together, rested idly in her lap. Mitchell&rsquo;s
profession had made him a close student of
human nature and as he studied her face, partly
turned from him, he concluded that Kitty did not
lack strength of character and will power, whatever
her faults might be.</p>

<p>Was her air of relaxation, of almost dumb inertia,
a cloak to hide high-strung, quivering nerves? If
he could but shake her composure, he might gain
some key to the mystery of her aunt&rsquo;s murder. Mitchell
cleared his throat as he unobtrusively hitched
his chair around to obtain a more favorable angle
from which to gauge her expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had your aunt a large correspondence?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>Kitty shook her head. &ldquo;Aunt Susan abominated
letter-writing,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;My godfather, Mr.
Craige, attended to her few business correspondents
and I answered any invitations that came to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had you any relations living outside of Washington?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few very distant cousins.&rdquo; She shrugged her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>shoulders. &ldquo;My aunt did not encourage intercourse
with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their names, please?&rdquo; Mitchell pulled out a
pencil and notebook and thumbed its pages until he
found a blank space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A. J. Beekman of Detroit.&rdquo; Kitty watched him
in some amusement. &ldquo;Then there was rather a large
family of Smiths in Georgia&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t be
more definite. Aunt Susan, as I said before, never
cultivated her relatives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she actively dislike them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty straightened up and regarded him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
catch your meaning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My meaning is clear.&rdquo; Mitchell spoke slowly,
deliberately. &ldquo;Did your aunt actively dislike Major
Leigh Wallace because of his relationship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His relationship?&rdquo; echoed Kitty in bewilderment.
&ldquo;He is no relation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; with a sarcastic smile. &ldquo;I happen
to know that Leigh Wallace is your cousin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then your knowledge is greater than mine.&rdquo;
Kitty curbed her quick temper with an effort and
added more quietly, &ldquo;Whoever told you that was
misinformed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not.&rdquo; Mitchell consulted his notebook
before continuing. &ldquo;Colonel Marcus Holt of San
Francisco, was your uncle, was he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. My mother, Louise Holt, was his sister.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>Kitty slipped her arms out of her coat which she
had kept on for warmth. The fire was drawing
nicely and for the first time she was conscious of
the heat it generated. &ldquo;What prompts your interest
in old Colonel Holt? I assure you he died long before
Aunt Susan.&rdquo; There was a touch of mockery
in her voice and Mitchell smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am coming to my point,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Holt&rsquo;s
nephew is Major Leigh Wallace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty sat bolt upright with such suddenness that
Mouchette nearly lost her balance. With an offended
air, the cat jumped to the floor and crept under
the nearest chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Kitty. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And therefore,&rdquo; went on Mitchell, paying no
attention to her interruption. &ldquo;Leigh Wallace must
be a relation of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Kitty admitted thoughtfully. &ldquo;But
why had Leigh never told me that we are related?
He has never spoken of being a nephew of Uncle
Marcus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor of inheriting the old colonel&rsquo;s fortune?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fortune?&rdquo; Kitty looked blank. &ldquo;Why, I have
always understood that Major Wallace had only his
pay. I never knew that he was wealthy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His fortune disappeared, the way fortunes have
when dissipated away,&rdquo; Mitchell was watching her
like a lynx, but her expression of friendly interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>conveyed that and nothing more. The mention of
Leigh Wallace&rsquo;s name had not produced the result
he had hoped for. Kitty&rsquo;s composure had not been
shaken. Could it be that she was not in love with
him, as rumor reported? Mitchell frowned. He
was not making headway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever heard of the Holt will contest in
San Francisco?&rdquo; he asked, after a brief pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only in a general way. Aunt Susan spoke of it
once or twice.&rdquo; Kitty settled back in her chair
again. &ldquo;She never evinced any particular interest in
Uncle Marcus, and he on his part ignored our existence.
To go back to ancient history&mdash;&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s
smile was a trifle mischievous; keeping Inspector
Mitchell discussing harmless topics would prevent
his harping upon her aunt&rsquo;s death, and perhaps
would hasten his departure&mdash;&ldquo;Uncle Marcus objected
to mother marrying my father, and naturally
Aunt Susan resented the fact that her brother was
unwelcome to his wife&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she nursed a grudge against them, did she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; she simply had nothing to do with
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then this money which your aunt left to you
couldn&rsquo;t have been given to her by Colonel Holt in
his lifetime?&rdquo; asked Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, <i>no</i>.&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s astonishment was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>plain. &ldquo;Aunt Susan&rsquo;s prejudices were stronger even
than her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love of money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty flushed hotly. &ldquo;I do not care to have slurs
cast upon my aunt,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;She is not
here to defend herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Miss Baird,&rdquo; Mitchell protested. &ldquo;You
must realize that your aunt hoarded this wealth
which you inherited; otherwise she would have
spoken to you or to some one about it. She&mdash;&rdquo;
Mitchell came to a full pause, then added impressively:
&ldquo;Your aunt was a miser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty&rsquo;s color deepened, but the denial which loyalty
prompted remained unspoken. Her sense of
justice told her that Inspector Mitchell had spoken
truly. What other motive, except love of money,
had induced her aunt to live in poverty when she
had ample funds to enable her to enjoy every luxury
which money could buy?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I to conclude from your questions,&rdquo; she began,
&ldquo;that you connect my aunt&rsquo;s hidden wealth
with her murder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems a reasonable hypothesis,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;Take the known facts about the murder&mdash;first,
your aunt was alone in the house on Sunday afternoon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was she?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything to the contrary?&rdquo; quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. But,&rdquo; she hesitated, &ldquo;some one must have
been inside the house as well as my aunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that some one&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murdered my aunt,&rdquo; looking him calmly in the
eyes. &ldquo;She never committed suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell regarded her steadfastly. &ldquo;Can you give
me no hint of the identity of your aunt&rsquo;s caller?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;Think carefully, Miss Baird. Have you
no suspicion who <i>might</i> have murdered your aunt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty did not reply at once; instead her hand
slipped inside her coat pocket and her fingers closed
about the small slip of mauve-colored paper tucked
underneath her handkerchief, while the message it
bore recurred to her: &ldquo;Leigh, you are watched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To what did Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; warning allude? To
what <i>could</i> it allude? And why did Inspector Mitchell
invariably drag Leigh Wallace&rsquo;s name into
their conversation? And what had inspired her
aunt&rsquo;s hatred of Leigh? Could it have been fear?
Fear of what&mdash;Death? Kitty shuddered, then
pulled herself together. She must not let fancies
run away with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know of no one who could have had a motive
for killing poor Aunt Susan,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It must
have been the work of some one afflicted with homicidal
tendencies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stake my reputation that it was no maniac,&rdquo;
declared Mitchell. &ldquo;The crime was deliberately
planned and by some one with nerves absolutely
under control. Look at the manner in which the
poison was administered&mdash;placed on one side of the
knife-blade, so that the prussic acid only touched the
piece of peach given to your aunt, and the murderer
ate his half in perfect safety. It was neat, devilishly
neat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you found out where the peaches came
from?&rdquo; asked Kitty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, worse luck.&rdquo; Mitchell frowned. &ldquo;Very few
fruit stores make deliveries on Sunday and those
few deny sending any fruit here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about the Italian fruit stands? Have you
questioned the dealers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell smiled wryly. &ldquo;Not many fruit dealers
carry peaches at this season. Our operatives have
been pretty thorough in their investigations.&rdquo; He
paused before adding, &ldquo;According to their reports
no one, man, woman, or child, purchased peaches on
Sunday last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty hesitated. &ldquo;They may have come from a
distance,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;By parcel post or express.
Have you thought of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we found that no package was left here
by the express company or post office employees.&rdquo;
Mitchell paused to replace his notebook and pencil in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>his pocket. &ldquo;No, Miss Baird, the murderer brought
those peaches with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would seem so,&rdquo; agreed Kitty, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it must have been some one who knew that
your aunt liked peaches,&rdquo; went on Mitchell. &ldquo;Were
her tastes generally known among your friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty caught her breath sharply. The question
recalled an incident forgotten in the rush of events.
Leigh Wallace, on the few occasions when he had
been invited to tea with them, had invariably preceded
his visit with a basket of fruit, and&mdash;each
basket had contained peaches!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose our friends knew that Aunt Susan
liked peaches,&rdquo; she said. Her hesitation, slight as it
was, was not lost on Mitchell. &ldquo;I never gave the
matter a thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; Mitchell did not try to conceal his
unbelief. &ldquo;Do you see much of Mr. Edward Rodgers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty actually jumped at the abruptness of the
question and its nature. &ldquo;What earthly business is
it of yours whether I see Mr. Rodgers or not?&rdquo; she
demanded indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not my business.&rdquo; Mitchell smiled apologetically.
&ldquo;It just occurred to me that he might
have mentioned the Holt will contest to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To me?&rdquo; in genuine surprise. &ldquo;Why should he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>speak about Uncle Marcus and the contest over his
will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Mitchell whirled his hat
about. &ldquo;Mr. Rodgers was called in as a handwriting expert.
It was one of his big cases, and I
thought it likely he might have talked it over with
you, seeing Colonel Holt was your uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt if Mr. Rodgers knows that we were related.
From what I have seen of Mr. Rodgers,&rdquo;
her color rose as she spoke, &ldquo;I judge he seldom
discusses himself or his work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not.&rdquo; Mitchell walked over to the side
door and laid his hand on the knob. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t detain
you any longer, Miss Baird. If you should think
of any one who ever evinced any great interest in
your aunt&rsquo;s fondness for peaches, just telephone me.
Good afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Left to herself Kitty stepped up to the fireplace
and taking out the piece of mauve-colored paper held
it suspended over the flames. But her clutching fingers
did not relax their grasp and finally she tucked
the paper in the belt of her dress. She laughed
mirthlessly as she walked across the library and felt
about for a box of matches. Inspector Mitchell,
whether he had attained the object of his call or not,
had sown seeds of suspicion.</p>

<p>It had grown quite dark and the room, lighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>only by fire, was filled with shadows. Kitty passed
a nervous hand over the table ornaments&mdash;the
matchbox which usually stood near the oil lamp had
evidently been misplaced. She was about to look
elsewhere when the sound of voices reached her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;se done looked an&rsquo; looked,&rdquo; she heard Oscar
say. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I tell yo&rsquo; ole Miss never left no such
papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, please keep up your search,&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s
voice pleaded. &ldquo;Please, Oscar. I&rsquo;ll give you more
than I promised&mdash;a hundred dollars more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty straightened up and stared about her. The
voices sounded clearly in her ears, but surely she was
alone in the library? Running over to the tea table,
she felt about and snatched up the much-sought
matches. The next instant she was back at the lamp
and a second later the room was illuminated. She
was its only occupant.</p>

<p>Where had the voices come from? As her eyes
roved about the library she spied the &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; door
near where she was standing. The little panel in the
upper half of the door had been left open and
through it came faintly the sound of receding footsteps.</p>

<p>Throwing wide the door, Kitty stepped outside.
In the gathering darkness no one was visible. She
paused in thought, her troubled eyes trying to pierce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>the gloom of the desolate garden and the empty
pathway circling the mansion. The woman&rsquo;s voice
still echoed in her ears&mdash;where, where had she heard
its haunting quality before?</p><hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
AND CORRUPTION</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">K</span><span class="smcap">itty</span> paused before her bureau and inspected
herself in the mirror. It had been
a relief to change from her street clothes
to a dressing gown. She had spent nearly an hour
lying on the couch in her bedroom trying to piece
together the puzzling events of the afternoon. On
reëntering the house she had gone at once to the
servants&rsquo; quarters; from there she had searched
every room, even to the attic. To all appearances
Oscar was not in the house. She had then waited
in the library, hoping to catch him on his entrance,
but evidently he had accompanied the unknown
woman away from the house.</p>

<p>Kitty struck her hands together in impotent wrath
at the thought. Why had she not realized immediately
that the speakers were outside the house, and
not wasted precious minutes trying to light the lamp
in the library and thus given them time to slip away
unseen!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Who was the woman? Vainly, Kitty tried to
identify her voice. Strive as she did to recall where
she had heard it before, it eluded her memory. Why
should any woman bribe old Oscar to steal papers
which had belonged to her aunt?</p>

<p>With a sigh of utter weariness, Kitty gave up the
problem for the moment and continued her dressing.
Twenty minutes later, her toilet completed,
she stopped before the cheval glass and gave a final
pat to her hair. At last, satisfied with her appearance,
she hastened into the hall. As she descended
the staircase, she heard the rattle of dishes in the
dining room and the sound of the dumb-waiter
creaking its way upward. With flying footsteps she
covered the intervening space and crossed the hall to
the pantry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oscar!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;I wish to speak to you at
once. Come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the person who stepped from the dining room
into the pantry at her imperious summons was not
Oscar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What yo&rsquo; want, Miss Kitty?&rdquo; asked Mandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oscar!&rdquo; She repeated the old servant&rsquo;s name
with ever growing impatience. &ldquo;I must see him
immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laws, Miss Kitty, Oscar&rsquo;s on his way to Front
Royal, Virginia, dis hyar minute,&rdquo; explained Mandy,
in no wise hurrying her leisurely speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;On his way where?&rdquo; gasped Kitty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Front Royal.&rdquo; Mandy lifted her apron and
produced from a voluminous pocket a much twisted
telegram. &ldquo;He done got dis hyar message to come
at wandst &rsquo;cause his brother, the one dat owns a
farm five miles from Front Royal, is a dyin&rsquo;. See
what dey done wrote,&rdquo; and she held out the telegram.
Kitty read the typed lines with interest before
handing the telegram back to Mandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me of this?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;Oscar had no business to leave without first speaking
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laws, Miss Kitty, yo&rsquo; warn&rsquo;t in de house an&rsquo; we
didn&rsquo;t know when yo&rsquo; &rsquo;spected to be back,&rdquo; Mandy
explained. &ldquo;Oscar had to catch the three o&rsquo;clock
train to get there to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The three o&rsquo;clock train,&rdquo; Kitty repeated. &ldquo;The
three o&rsquo;clock train <i>this afternoon</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; Kitty passed a bewildered hand across
her forehead. &ldquo;Oscar was here at five o&rsquo;clock&mdash;here
at this house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; Mandy&rsquo;s eyes opened, showing the
whites more clearly. &ldquo;What yo&rsquo; talkin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout, Miss
Kitty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oscar was here this afternoon at five o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo;
Kitty stated, speaking more deliberately so as to
make certain that Mandy understood what she said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>&ldquo;I overheard him talking to a woman just outside
the library door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; did!&rdquo; Mandy&rsquo;s uplifted voice as well as her
expression registered complete astonishment. &ldquo;Did
yo&rsquo; see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I tell you I overheard him talking to a
woman.&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s temper was gaining the upper
hand, and she spoke with warmth. &ldquo;I know Oscar&rsquo;s
voice, Mandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Kitty,&rdquo; but the old colored woman
still looked unconvinced. &ldquo;Dar&rsquo;s a heap o&rsquo; niggers
talks jes&rsquo; like Oscar. Is yo&rsquo; sure it warn&rsquo;t dat worthless
&rsquo;Rastus from nex&rsquo; do&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it was not &rsquo;Rastus,&rdquo; declared Kitty, with
emphasis. &ldquo;Besides, the woman, in speaking to
Oscar, addressed him by name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did?&rdquo; Mandy fell back a step and stared at
Kitty. &ldquo;Oh, go &rsquo;way, Miss Kitty, yo&rsquo; been dreamin&rsquo;&mdash;why,
&rsquo;twarn&rsquo;t possible. I went to de depot with
Oscar my own self an&rsquo; saw Oscar get on dat train,
an&rsquo; it done pull out fo&rsquo; Front Royal at three o&rsquo;clock
this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Kitty&rsquo;s turn to stare at Mandy. The old
woman&rsquo;s beady black eyes did not shift their gaze.
A full minute passed before Kitty broke the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you return, Mandy?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout six or a few minutes after,&rdquo; Mandy said.
&ldquo;I come upstairs an&rsquo; listened to hear ef yo&rsquo; was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>de house. I didn&rsquo;t hear nuffin&rsquo; an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t see no
light, so I went back to de kitchen to get dinner. I
s&rsquo;posed yo&rsquo; hadn&rsquo;t come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was lying down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mandy&rsquo;s worried expression changed to one of
relief and she did not permit Kitty to finish her
sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dar now, I &rsquo;spects yo&rsquo; jes&rsquo; drap off to sleep an&rsquo;
dreamed &rsquo;bout Oscar bein&rsquo; hyar,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Dat was it, Honey, dat was it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, was that it?&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s voice lacked heartiness.
&ldquo;All right, Mandy. Serve dinner when it is
ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Kitty; it won&rsquo;t be a minute now. I&rsquo;se
got a real tasty chicken a broilin&rsquo;. Jes&rsquo; go set down,
chile; trust ole Mandy to look after yo&rsquo;.&rdquo; And she
gave the girl&rsquo;s arm a friendly squeeze as Kitty passed
her to go into the dining room.</p>

<p>Kitty did not sit down at once. Her thoughts
were in a turmoil as she paced up and down the
room. Was Mandy right? Had she dreamed overhearing
an unknown woman offer Oscar a bribe to
steal papers which had belonged to her aunt? Her
aimless footsteps carried her into the library and to
the Dutch door. The small panel stood open.
Kitty&rsquo;s eyes strayed from it to the telephone. On
impulse she crossed to the instrument and took up
the telephone directory. It took her but a moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>to find the number she wished, then she paused.
Should she call Edward Rodgers or her cousin, Ben
Potter?</p>

<p>She had seen or heard nothing from either Ben
or his wife since late Tuesday afternoon after the
inquest, when they had stopped for a brief moment
to tell of their contemplated trip to New York and
to suggest that she accompany them. She had been
tempted to accept their invitation. A longing to run
away from the mansion which she had called home
from her earliest recollection, to separate herself
from the tragedy of her aunt&rsquo;s murder had almost
overpowered her. But her sense of horror at the
crime, her determination to solve the mystery and
bring her aunt&rsquo;s murderer to justice had conquered,
and she had stayed on at the old house, refusing to
follow Charles Craige&rsquo;s suggestion that she engage
a trained nurse as a companion and go to a hotel.
Nina Potter had promised to telephone to her immediately
upon their return from New York, but so
far she had received no message from her.</p>

<p>Kitty felt urgent need of clear-headed advice.
Instinctively, she took up the telephone instrument.
She had not seen Edward Rodgers since Tuesday
night when they had discovered her aunt&rsquo;s will
secreted under the plaster cast of the Gila monster,
but he would come at her call&mdash;her woman&rsquo;s instinct
told her that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>The telephone bell sounded with such suddenness
that she almost dropped the instrument. Recovering
herself she took off the receiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Miss Baird?&rdquo; Edward Rodgers&rsquo;
deep tones were music in her ears. &ldquo;Will you be in
this evening? Can I see you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His questions came in such swift succession that
Kitty had no chance to answer each individually.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do come,&rdquo; she called back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be very glad to
see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Righto&mdash;&rdquo; The connection was poor and his
voice sounded faintly over the wires. &ldquo;In about an
hour.&rdquo; With heightened color she hung up the receiver
and Mandy, entering the dining room some
seconds later, found her sitting demurely at her place
at the head of the table, waiting patiently for the
&ldquo;tasty&rdquo; broiled chicken.</p>

<p>During the service of the meal, Mandy kept up a
running chatter of conversation, talking on any subject,
regardless of its relevancy. Several times
Kitty regarded her in surprise; it was not like Mandy
to be garrulous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been fixin&rsquo; to tell yo&rsquo;,&rdquo; she announced as she
removed the dessert plate, &ldquo;dat Mrs. Potter done
telephone yo&rsquo; jes&rsquo; a few minutes after yo&rsquo; left this
mawnin&rsquo;. I declare yo&rsquo; put it outer my haid when
yo&rsquo; telled me &rsquo;bout yo&rsquo; dreamin&rsquo; Oscar was hyar at
five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Mrs. Potter say how she was, Mandy?&rdquo;
asked Kitty, as she arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had a mighty bad cold an&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t hardly
hear what she said, noways.&rdquo; Mandy advanced,
silver coffee pot in hand. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; gwine ter
take yo&rsquo; coffee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in the library. And Mandy, bring another
cup,&rdquo; Kitty paused. &ldquo;I am expecting Mr. Rodgers.
There is the bell now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mandy was smiling to herself as she walked toward
the front door. Her smile broadened into an
expansive grin at sight of Edward Rodgers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come right in, Sah: Miss Kitty&rsquo;s &rsquo;spectin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; in
the lib&rsquo;ry.&rdquo; She hovered about while he removed
his hat and overcoat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;se glad yo&rsquo;ve come; Miss
Kitty&rsquo;s kinda peaked. It&rsquo;s nice yo&rsquo; can keep her
company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Rodgers&rsquo; dry tone was totally lost on
Mandy. With a flourishing twist of the portières
in front of the library door she announced:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mister Rodgers&mdash;&rdquo; and discreetly disappeared
inside her pantry.</p>

<p>As Kitty felt Rodgers&rsquo; strong handclasp and met
his ardent gaze, her heart beat more swiftly. Rodgers,
scarcely conscious that he still held her hand,
was unaware of the brief pause, being content to
watch Kitty&rsquo;s piquant beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to see you&mdash;to be with you,&rdquo; he
stammered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been an eternity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty&rsquo;s soft laugh interrupted him. &ldquo;Come and
sit down,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m particularly glad you
came to-night, for I want your advice badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; Rodgers followed her to the leather-covered
lounge and sat down by her. &ldquo;What
about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; Kitty had caught the sound of Mandy&rsquo;s
heavy tread in the hall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later after
we have had our coffee. Come in, Mandy.&rdquo; Kitty
raised her voice. &ldquo;Bring the tray here and place it
on this table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Rodgers&rsquo; aid the old servant made room on
the table for her tray, then, with a respectful &ldquo;good
night,&rdquo; she stumped away, taking care to drop the
portières back in place. As Rodgers bent to pick up
a napkin which he had inadvertently dropped, Kitty
caught sight of the cuts on his head partially covered
by a dressing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! What have you done to yourself?&rdquo;
she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ran head first into a door,&rdquo; replied Rodgers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you are not badly hurt?&rdquo; she asked
gravely, noting the pallor of his usually ruddy
cheeks. At the solicitude in her voice Rodgers colored
and his eyes shone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; he said, then made haste to change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>the subject. &ldquo;Have you seen Ben Potter to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Nina telephoned to me this morning while
I was out.&rdquo; She handed him her empty coffee cup
to put down. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Ben since the day of
the inquest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers hesitated a moment. &ldquo;Forgive the
question&mdash;but&mdash;are you and he great friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty regarded him gravely. &ldquo;Not great
friends; we sometimes have spats,&rdquo; she admitted.
A mischievous smile brought out her pretty dimples.
&ldquo;Our last dispute was on the subject of deportment
and dress. I do not see how Nina stands his Puritanical
ideas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he approve of gay colors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gay colors!&rdquo; Kitty laughed outright. &ldquo;I
should say not. Why, he nearly had a fit whenever
I appeared in my red coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a man of queer ideas,&rdquo; Rodgers commented
dryly. &ldquo;The red coat was most becoming to you.
By the way, I haven&rsquo;t seen you wear it lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am having the coat dyed&mdash;&rdquo; Seeing his surprised
expression, she added, &ldquo;Not because Ben disliked
the color, but it was too faded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did <i>you</i> take the coat to be dyed?&rdquo; asked Rodgers,
and she wondered at the persistency of his
gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I gave it to Aunt Susan one day last
week.&rdquo; Kitty sat bolt upright. &ldquo;Dear me, I won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>der
at which cleaning establishment she left the
coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no idea where it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the faintest idea in this world; Aunt Susan
never dealt long at any one shop.&rdquo; Kitty shook
her head. &ldquo;The events of the past few days put the
coat entirely out of my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then your aunt was the last person to have your
coat&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was certainly the last person in this household
to handle it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You speak as if
the coat was of some consequence&mdash;&rdquo; with a quick
surprised glance at him.</p>

<p>Rogers paused as Oscar&rsquo;s warning recurred to
him &ldquo;She mustn&rsquo;t know nawthin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Whatever
the old negro&rsquo;s reasons might be for asking him not
to discuss the red coat with Kitty&mdash;whether important
or unimportant&mdash;he would keep faith with the
old negro and not tell her of the incidents of the
morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always liked the coat,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Suppose
you don&rsquo;t get it back&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the cleaners, whoever they are, will probably
send it back when it is dyed so as to get paid,&rdquo;
she answered carelessly. &ldquo;It is a small loss anyway
for the coat was about worn out.&rdquo; She sighed involuntarily
and Rodgers looked at her intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this house getting on your nerves?&rdquo; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>asked, observing the deep shadows under her eyes
which told their story of wakeful nights and frayed
nerves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so much the house as the mystery,&rdquo; she admitted,
with a slight shiver. &ldquo;Have you discovered
any clues?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers touched a small &ldquo;I.O.U.&rdquo; paper safely
tucked inside his vest pocket. &ldquo;Nothing of any
consequence,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;I tried to see Inspector
Mitchell this afternoon, but he never returned to
Headquarters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was here.&rdquo; Kitty paused and considered her
companion. The mention of Inspector Mitchell
brought back his questions about the Holt will contest.
&ldquo;By the way, the inspector asked if you had
ever told me about the law suit over Colonel Holt&rsquo;s
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers laid down his cigarette case unopened.
&ldquo;The Holt will case,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Of what possible
interest could that be to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel Holt was my uncle.&rdquo; Observing his
surprised expression, she added, &ldquo;The inspector
suggested that perhaps the fortune Aunt Susan left
to me was given to her by Colonel Holt. I told him
the idea was preposterous. Why, Aunt Susan
would have nothing to do with Uncle Marcus. To
my knowledge she never saw him. I doubt if he
even knew of my existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodgers selected a cigarette. &ldquo;May I smoke?&rdquo;
he asked, and for answer she handed him a box of
matches. &ldquo;I wish you and Colonel Holt had known
each other. He was a fine old man; looked like a
soldier of the French Empire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he a friend of yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew him slightly in a business way.&rdquo; Rodgers
puffed at his cigarette until he had it drawing
nicely. &ldquo;How did Mitchell come to know that you
were related?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Kitty laughed a trifle vexedly.
&ldquo;The inspector evidently informed himself as to my
relations; he even told me that Leigh Wallace and I
are cousins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers favored the &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; clock across
the library with a prolonged stare. Kitty was commencing
to wonder at his silence, when he turned
and addressed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you and Leigh are cousins,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had
not realized that before. How near is the relationship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are first cousins, if what Inspector Mitchell
said is true. My mother was Louise Holt, and I
suppose her half-sister, Anne, was Leigh&rsquo;s mother.
Odd, is it not, that Leigh never spoke of being related
to me?&rdquo; she added, after a slight pause.</p>

<p>Rodgers&rsquo; gaze was transferred from the clock to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>Kitty. &ldquo;Was your aunt aware of the relationship?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I imagine not. We haven&rsquo;t spoken of Colonel
Holt for years,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Inspector Mitchell
said the law suit was one of your big cases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was called in as a handwriting expert.&rdquo; Rodgers
moved restlessly. &ldquo;Has Mitchell discovered
any clues to your aunt&rsquo;s murder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he has, he has not confided them to me,&rdquo; she
smiled mirthlessly. &ldquo;He has succeeded in making me
feel very uncomfortable&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With his suspicions,&rdquo; she hesitated. &ldquo;He insinuated
that&mdash;&rdquo; she did not complete her sentence;
her eyes had strayed to the framed photograph of
Leigh Wallace standing on a near-by table. After
all, she could not voice her suspicions to Edward
Rodgers. For nearly a month she had been aware
of a growing coolness between the two men, and
Wallace had been at no pains to conceal his anger
whenever he had seen Kitty walking or motoring
with Rodgers. Kitty had never detected any alteration
in Rodgers&rsquo; manner to Wallace. Whatever
his opinion of the latter&rsquo;s surly behavior it had
been cloaked under his customary air of good fellowship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have something to tell you of more importance
than Inspector Mitchell&rsquo;s veiled insinuations,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>she said, speaking rapidly to cover her change of
topic. &ldquo;Just after the Inspector&rsquo;s departure I was
standing here by this table,&rdquo; indicating it as she
spoke, &ldquo;when the sound of voices reached me and I
heard Oscar say: &lsquo;I&rsquo;se done looked an&rsquo; looked, an&rsquo;
I tell yo&rsquo; ole Miss never left no sech papers.&rsquo; And
a woman&rsquo;s voice replied: &lsquo;Please, please keep up
your search, Oscar. I&rsquo;ll give you more than I
promised&mdash;a hundred dollars more.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers threw away his cigarette and stared at
Kitty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was the woman?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo; Kitty rose and walked over to
the Dutch door. &ldquo;I tried to light the library lamp
and wasted valuable seconds hunting for matches.
When I finally got the lamp lighted, I found that I
was alone in the library and the voices had come
through this panel,&rdquo; laying her hand on it as she
spoke. &ldquo;I dashed outside but Oscar and his companion
had disappeared in the darkness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers followed her to the Dutch door, his face
expressing both astonishment and deep attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you no idea who the woman was?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t Oscar told you her name and why
she was bribing him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oscar,&rdquo; Kitty paused and looked carefully about
the library. &ldquo;Oscar, according to his wife, took the
three o&rsquo;clock train to Front Royal this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He did <i>what</i>?&rdquo; shouted Rodgers, then at her
startled look, he added more quietly, &ldquo;Do you
mean that Oscar has left Washington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Mandy told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers considered Kitty in silence.... Oscar
a runaway&mdash;the red coat practically destroyed by
fire&mdash;the I.O.U.&mdash;</p>

<p>Kitty was commencing to wonder at the prolonged
silence when Rodgers spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what hour did you overhear Oscar&rsquo;s conversation
with the unknown woman?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers stroked his chin thoughtfully. &ldquo;I
should say that there was a nigger in the wood-pile,&rdquo;
he said softly. &ldquo;You are quite sure it was Oscar
talking to the woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely positive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you recognize the woman&rsquo;s voice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty shook her head. &ldquo;Her voice haunts me
still,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I cannot place it. The whole
affair bewilders me. I do not know what to think,
what to conjecture. Our Oscar and Mandy, my
aunt&rsquo;s faithful old servants, in league against me?
Has some one bribed them to lie and steal&mdash;and with
what object?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers did not reply at once. Suddenly he
reached over and, pressing the catch, slid the panel
back and forth as Inspector Mitchell had done sev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>eral
hours previously. His action reminded Kitty
of the incident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That panel seems to fascinate you men,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Inspector Mitchell spent fully ten minutes
commenting upon its well oiled hinges and its
possible use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its use?&rdquo; Rodgers&rsquo; voice was of the carrying
quality, and it sounded distinctly through the open
panel to a figure crouching in the shadow of the
house. &ldquo;Has the panel been used for any special
purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is purely ornamental.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the postman ever drop mail through it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Our mail box is fastened to the front
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers&rsquo; gaze had strayed to the floor. Stooping
down he rubbed his hand over the bare hardwood
boards. &ldquo;Your flooring is well worn right
here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some weight or some one has
stood here constantly. Bend closer and you will
see that the varnish is completely worn away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty followed his suggestion. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo;
she exclaimed, standing erect. &ldquo;It bewilders
me. What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one has been using this panel&mdash;for what
purpose we have yet to find out.&rdquo; Rodgers spoke
half to himself, then asked more loudly: &ldquo;Have
you given all your aunt&rsquo;s papers to Mr. Craige?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;even old letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know their contents?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not stop to read them all.&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s troubled
expression deepened. &ldquo;I gave him every
paper I could find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad Mr. Craige has them,&rdquo; exclaimed
Rodgers heartily. &ldquo;If he has the papers which the
woman bribed Oscar to secure for her, we can solve
<i>that</i> mystery. There is just one other question,
Miss Baird. Did your aunt see very much of Mrs.
Amos Parsons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside in the shadows the listening figure stiffened
as it bent dangerously close to catch Kitty&rsquo;s
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not any more than Aunt Susan could help&mdash;&rdquo;
Kitty&rsquo;s tired young voice held a hint of mirth as it
came through the open panel. &ldquo;She abominated
Mrs. Parsons and deeply resented my acting as her
secretary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers contemplated Kitty for several seconds,
then stepped briskly toward the telephone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your permission,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call up Mr.
Craige and ask if he can see us this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap2">&ldquo;</span><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">har</span> yo&rsquo; goin&rsquo;, Honey, at dis time o&rsquo;
night?&rdquo; Mandy&rsquo;s voice was raised in
shocked expostulation and Kitty could
not refrain from a smile. She had interrupted the
old servant in the act of arranging her bedroom
for the night when she had entered a moment before
and taken her heavy overcoat and hat out of
the closet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rodgers is going to run me over to see my
godfather, Mr. Craige,&rdquo; she explained as she arranged
her veil. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait up for me, Mandy;
I have the key of the side door and can let myself in.
You are not afraid to stay here alone, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m.&rdquo; But Mandy spoke with no enthusiasm.
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t skeered, kexactly, but yo&rsquo; won&rsquo;t be very
late, will yo&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; Kitty glanced at the clock on her
dressing table. &ldquo;It is only a quarter of nine,
Mandy; I&rsquo;ll be back within the hour. Sit down be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>fore
the fire,&rdquo; pointing to the grate where Mandy,
with solicitous forethought had built a coal fire for
her young mistress to enjoy when undressing, &ldquo;and
make yourself comfortable. Don&rsquo;t stay in a cold
kitchen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank yo&rsquo;, Miss Kitty. I &rsquo;spects I&rsquo;d ruther
stay up hyar, it&rsquo;s mo&rsquo; cheerful.&rdquo; Mandy walked
into the hall with her. &ldquo;Mind yo&rsquo; keep that collar
buttoned up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Mandy.&rdquo; Kitty, touched by the old
woman&rsquo;s care for her, laid her hand for a minute
on her rounded shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry and keep
warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mandy waited in the hall, her woolly head, covered
with a bright bandanna handkerchief, cocked in
a listening attitude until she heard Kitty and Ted
Rodgers depart and the side door closed. Taking a
general survey of the empty hall, Mandy limped
back into Kitty&rsquo;s bedroom and drew a tufted armchair
up to the grate, selecting a &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo;
from those stored in the hall closet and wrapping
herself in it, she settled down in the chair. For a
time she was wakeful, but as the hands of the clock
approached the hour, her head drooped sideways
and a subdued snore gave proof that she had fallen
asleep. So sound was her slumber that the incessant
clatter of the bell on the branch telephone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>which Kitty had had installed the day before, made
no impression upon her.</p>

<p>From her corner near the fire the angora cat,
Mouchette, slumbered also. A shower of sparks, as
a piece of burning cannel-coal dropped through the
grate, singed her fur and woke her just as a figure
crept through the partly open bedroom door and into
the room. Its objective seemed to be an old-fashioned
secretary in the southeast corner of the
room. At sight of Mandy, asleep in the chair, the
intruder paused, listened attentively to her regular
breathing, then, reassured, moved onward across
the room, followed by Mouchette&rsquo;s large yellow
eyes.</p>

<p>The cat licked her singed fur, then, with a faint
&ldquo;mew,&rdquo; started in the direction of the secretary. A
second later a graceful leap had landed her on the
chair beside it, and she purred contentedly as the intruder
turned and gently stroked her head. In her
chair by the fire old Mandy snored peacefully, oblivious
alike of the rustle of papers being removed
from the secretary and the antics of the cat.</p>

<p>Kitty was relieved to find Ted Rodgers a silent
companion as they drove out to Chevy Chase, for
she was in no mood for small talk. The rush of
the cold air against her hot cheeks and the steady
throb of the motor as the car raced up one hill and
down another brought a sense of relaxation and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>rest to her tired nerves. A restless longing to get
out of the house, away from her thoughts, had pursued
her all day. The big, silent man by her side and
his air of protection were a tonic in themselves, and
she forgot her sorrows and perplexities in the enjoyment
of the unexpected trip to Chevy Chase, Washington&rsquo;s
fashionable suburb.</p>

<p>Nearly a year before, Charles Craige had purchased
from one of his clients a cottage in Chevy
Chase and had moved his Lares and Penates from
his bachelor apartment in the Hadleigh. His English
butler, Lambert, and the latter&rsquo;s wife, Mildred,
ran his house for him, as they had his apartment.
Invitations to his hospitable entertainments were
eagerly sought, for he was a born host and nothing
gave him more delight than to have his friends
about him. Mothers with marriageable daughters
and widows never lost hope of catching so worthwhile
a <i>parti</i> and Craige had been reported engaged
upon numerous occasions. Kitty had always entertained
a genuine affection for her godfather, to
whose kind offices she had owed many attentions
upon her début in Washington society. It was he
who had introduced her to Mrs. Parsons, and
through his suggestion the gay widow had secured
Kitty as her social secretary.</p>

<p>In what seemed an incredibly short time to Kitty,
Ted Rodgers drove his roadster under the <i>porte-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>cochère</i>
of &ldquo;Hideaway.&rdquo; Lambert came immediately
in answer to Kitty&rsquo;s ring, and his usually
solemn manner thawed at the sight of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The master will be &rsquo;ere in a moment,&rdquo; he explained,
helping them off with their wraps. &ldquo;Just
step into the living room, Miss Kitty. I &rsquo;ave a
fresh fire laid there. Mr. Craige told me you were
h&rsquo;expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The living room always aroused Ted Rodgers&rsquo;
admiration, for it represented his idea of comfort
combined with good taste. Craige had a love of
art and an appreciation of the beautiful and ample
means to gratify both. In furnishing his house,
he had spared no expense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Susan was very fond of this room,&rdquo; Kitty
said as she wandered about examining the paintings
on the walls. &ldquo;She and Mr. Craige were great
cronies. In fact,&rdquo; and Kitty&rsquo;s smile showed each
pretty dimple, &ldquo;he was about the only man she
approved of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she told me,&rdquo; Rodgers&rsquo; smile was fleeting.
&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t in her good graces&mdash;&rdquo; he stooped to pick
up the fire-tongs which Lambert had inadvertently
left lying on the floor before the brass fender when
hurrying to answer the front door bell. &ldquo;Your aunt
gave me to understand at our last interview that I
was <i>persona non grata</i>. Had she lived,&rdquo; Rodgers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>paused and looked at Kitty, &ldquo;I imagine she would
have tried to turn you against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty blushed. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t you in particular,&rdquo; she
began impulsively. &ldquo;Aunt Susan was frequently
discourteous to my friends. There were none she
liked when she found they&mdash;they&mdash;that is, that they
liked me.&rdquo; She laughed to cover her confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They wished to marry you&mdash;as I do&mdash;&rdquo; the
words caught her unawares. &ldquo;Kitty, my darling,&rdquo;
he pleaded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn from me; give me a chance.
I&rsquo;ve loved you so silently, so deeply&mdash;&rdquo; his voice
shook with feeling. &ldquo;You have grown to be my
life&mdash;my religion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; you must hear me, Kitty.&rdquo; He was pale
with the intensity of his emotion. &ldquo;I thought that
I could be content just to see you&mdash;to be with you;
but it has gone beyond that. I must <i>know</i> if there
is a chance for me. Is there, my dearest? I know
that I am unworthy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty&rsquo;s heart was beating to suffocation as she
turned bravely and faced him. She had flirted
many a time before and had turned aside a proposal
with light-hearted banter, but her coquetry had deserted
her utterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ted!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kitty!&rdquo; In an instant his arms were about her.
&ldquo;Kitty!&rdquo; His voice deepened. &ldquo;My best be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>loved&mdash;&rdquo;
and as she raised her head to look into his
eyes their lips met in the first kiss of love.</p>

<p>Forgetful of all else save each other, the lovers
were brought back to the everyday world and their
surroundings by a determined cough. Looking
hastily around, Kitty spied Charles Craige regarding
them from the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry to interrupt,&rdquo; he said dryly; then as Kitty
ran to him, her eyes like twin stars and the rich color
mantling her cheeks, his manner altered and his tone
grew tender. &ldquo;Dear child, in so far as I may, I give
you a father&rsquo;s blessing. Rodgers, you are to be
congratulated,&rdquo; and his hearty handshake emphasized
his words. His eyes strayed to a large portrait
photograph of Mrs. Amos Parsons which was
the chief ornament on the mantel-piece. &ldquo;I can understand
and appreciate your happiness,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;I hope some day soon to tell you I have won the
dearest woman in the world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except one&mdash;&rdquo; broke in Rodgers, glancing
proudly at Kitty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; agreed Craige cheerily. &ldquo;And
when is the engagement to be announced?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say a word about it, please,&rdquo; Kitty
begged; then, with a quick shy glance at Rodgers,
&ldquo;We must keep the secret until the mystery surrounding
Aunt Susan&rsquo;s death is solved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes a double incentive to clear up the case,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>declared Rodgers. &ldquo;Come, Kitty, sit by the fire and
I&rsquo;ll explain to Craige the errand which brought us
to see him to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obediently, Kitty curled herself up on the big
sofa which stood facing the huge open fireplace.
Her unhappy restlessness had deserted her. In its
stead a feeling of peace, of renewed courage and
unutterable happiness encompassed her, and she was
content to sit idly by and watch the two men. As
they stood with their backs to the fire, she was
struck by their distinguished appearance. Craige,
with his iron-grey hair and dark moustache, was
the handsomer of the two, but Kitty decided that
Rodgers&rsquo; more rugged features, offset by the deep
dimple, almost a cleft in his chin, indicated the more
determined character. His dark hair was inclined
to curl, in spite of every effort on his part to keep it
straight, and Kitty liked its wavy appearance better
than the severe style which Craige preferred. As
Craige held a match to Rodgers&rsquo; cigar she was surprised
by their similarity in height. Had any one
asked her she would have said that Rodgers was the
heavier and the taller by a quarter of an inch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This afternoon,&rdquo; Rodgers had waited to commence
his explanation of their call until his cigar
was drawing nicely. &ldquo;Kitty overheard an unknown
woman bribe Oscar to steal some papers which had
belonged to her aunt, Miss Susan Baird.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is interesting,&rdquo; Craige pulled his mustache
thoughtfully. &ldquo;You say the woman was unknown.
Describe her appearance, Kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, for I did not see her,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;The woman had gone when I looked into the garden,
and Oscar with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you haven&rsquo;t questioned Oscar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oscar,&rdquo; Kitty spoke more slowly, &ldquo;according
to Mandy, Oscar was on the train to Front Royal
this afternoon, but I can swear that it was Oscar I
heard; also the woman called him by name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it must have been Oscar,&rdquo; Craige commented
dryly. &ldquo;And Mandy lied to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could have been her object?&rdquo; asked Kitty.
&ldquo;She must realize that we can trace Oscar&rsquo;s whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is already being done by the police,&rdquo; Rodgers
put in quickly. &ldquo;I called up Inspector Mitchell
from your house, Kitty, while you were upstairs
getting your wraps, and told him that Oscar had
disappeared. He promised to try and locate the old
man at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Craige&rsquo;s tone spoke his satisfaction.
&ldquo;Now, as to the woman, did her voice give you no
clue to her identity, Kitty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I could not place it&mdash;&rdquo; Kitty hesitated. &ldquo;But
I am convinced that I have heard her voice before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; agreed Craige. &ldquo;It must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>been some one who knew your aunt, and therefore
is probably acquainted with you, also. Now, what
papers could she have wanted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the question which has brought us to see
you,&rdquo; Kitty explained. &ldquo;Yesterday I gave you the
contents of Aunt Susan&rsquo;s desk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her papers are here&mdash;&rdquo; As he spoke, Craige
went over to a table and pulling out one of the
drawers, carried it back to the sofa and put it down
by Kitty. &ldquo;Hereafter I will keep all Susan&rsquo;s papers
in my office vault, now that I know some one is
vitally interested in gaining possession of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you looked them over?&rdquo; questioned Rodgers.</p>

<p>Craige nodded assent. &ldquo;They are receipted bills
for taxes, marketing, and so forth. See, Kitty,&rdquo;
holding up a bundle neatly tied with red tape. &ldquo;Your
aunt was very methodical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was indeed,&rdquo; Kitty sighed as she untied one
of the bundles. &ldquo;Suppose we each take a package
and run through it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence prevailed while the packages were being
opened and gone over with a thoroughness which
omitted nothing. Kitty&rsquo;s nimble fingers made
quicker work of the knotted red tape and therefore
to her fell the last bundle in the drawer. As she
turned over the commonplace receipted bills, most
of them for groceries and coal, she thought bitterly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>of the frugality which she and her aunt had needlessly
practiced, and of the years she had spent in
denying herself pleasures which the average American
girl accepts, not as luxuries, but as necessities.
Expert bank officials had estimated the negotiable
securities and money left by her aunt as totalling
over eight hundred thousand dollars&mdash;nearly a million&mdash;and
her aunt had lived a life of genteel poverty
during all the years that Kitty could remember.</p>

<p>As Kitty sorted the bills in her lap, a small envelope,
yellow and worn with age, tumbled out. She
opened it and, unfolding the old-fashioned note
paper, read the cramped penmanship with some difficulty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is evidently a love letter addressed to Aunt
Susan,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; and she read
aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="right"><span class="smcap">Richmond, Va.</span>, April 1, 1867.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">My Darling Susan</span>:</p>

<p>I have called upon your mother and disclosed my
affection for you, and she has graciously given me
permission to marry you.</p>

<p>I hope that I may never meet with your disapprobation.</p>

<p>Transported with joy and expectation, I am</p>

<p class="right2">Your fond lover,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Leigh Wallace</span>.</p></div>

<p>Kitty looked at her companions in wide-eyed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>tonishment.
&ldquo;James Leigh Wallace,&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;Who could that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leigh Wallace&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; Rodgers replied. &ldquo;I
knew the old man. But&mdash;&rdquo; he paused, &ldquo;that James
Leigh Wallace married Colonel Holt&rsquo;s sister, Anne
Holt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige completed his examination of old receipts
and retied the bundle. &ldquo;Do you suppose, Kitty,
that your aunt could have been secretly married?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>For answer Kitty held up a small object and a
newspaper clipping which she had taken a second
before from the envelope containing the love letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a withered rose,&rdquo; she said softly, holding it
out in the palm of her hand. &ldquo;And this&mdash;&rdquo; she
opened the clipping&mdash;&ldquo;the notice of the marriage in
San Francisco of Anne Holt to James Leigh Wallace,
on April 1, 1869.&rdquo; She looked up in wonder.
&ldquo;See, here at the bottom of the clipping is written
one word in Aunt Susan&rsquo;s handwriting&mdash;&lsquo;jilted!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not surprising that Miss Susan Baird hated
young Leigh Wallace,&rdquo; he remarked quietly. &ldquo;She
was not the type of woman to forgive an injury or
forget an insult.&rdquo;</p>

A STARTLING ENCOUNTER</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">ed Rodgers</span> ran down the three steps
leading to the <i>porte-cochère</i> of &ldquo;Hideaway,&rdquo;
and opened the door of his car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to drive?&rdquo; he asked, turning to
Kitty standing in the doorway with Charles Craige.
Kitty&rsquo;s hesitation was brief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I would!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I feel all
keyed up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige smiled indulgently. &ldquo;Get as much pleasure
as you can,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;You deserve the good
things of life, Kitty. Now, put your aunt&rsquo;s tragic
death out of your mind&mdash;for to-night, at least,&rdquo; observing
her sober expression. &ldquo;I will see you to-morrow
and we will make a further search among
your aunt&rsquo;s belongings for the papers wanted so
mysteriously. Rodgers, take good care of her,&rdquo; and
he waved his hand in farewell as Kitty started the
car down the driveway.</p>

<p>Craige&rsquo;s picturesque cottage, &ldquo;Hideaway,&rdquo; concealed
from its neighbors by tall box hedges, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>located on a street near Chevy Chase Circle, and, as
their car made the turn around it, Rodgers bent
closer to Kitty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s run through Rock Creek Park,&rdquo; he coaxed.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very much further, and&mdash;&rdquo; his voice grew
very tender. &ldquo;I want so to talk to you all by yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty wavered a moment in doubt. She had
promised Mandy to return within the hour&mdash;but she
had already stayed more than an hour at her godfather&rsquo;s
home. Probably Mandy had long since
gone to bed. Rodgers&rsquo; hand on her&rsquo;s settled her
hesitation as, with tender clasp, he turned the steering
wheel toward the road leading into the park.</p>

<p>The heavy wind of the early evening had died
down and as they sped down the moonlit road
Kitty&rsquo;s cup of happiness seemed filled to the brim.
They drove in silence&mdash;the silence of perfect companionship
and understanding&mdash;each content with
the other&rsquo;s presence and their thought of one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop here a moment; the view over the Park is
wonderful.&rdquo; Rodgers leaned forward and pushed
up the windshield to the farthest limit. &ldquo;You can
see better now.&rdquo; But when Kitty slowed down at
the side of the road she found him regarding her
and not the moonlight on the rolling hills and valley
before them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You meant it, Kitty; you <i>do</i> care for me?&rdquo; he
asked wistfully. &ldquo;Really care?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty&rsquo;s soft laugh held happiness behind it. &ldquo;I
care so much&mdash;&rdquo; her voice dropped to a mere whisper
and he had to lean still closer to catch what she
said. &ldquo;My love is yours, always&mdash;always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers held her in close embrace. &ldquo;My beloved,&rdquo;
he murmured and he kissed her with a
fervor which left her breathless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ted,&rdquo; she said, a little later. &ldquo;Aunt Susan&rsquo;s
love letter haunts me. It told a pitiful story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded soberly. &ldquo;Perhaps that is what
warped her nature,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;James Leigh
Wallace was an out-and-out scoundrel. He gambled
his soul away&mdash;anything to gain money to lose in
some gambling hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard of him before,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Now
I understand Aunt Susan&rsquo;s antipathy to his son. I
thought it unreasoning dislike. Leigh&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so jealous of Leigh,&rdquo; Rodgers confessed.
&ldquo;Every one thought you were engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People are such idiots!&rdquo; she ejaculated, then
added almost in a whisper, &ldquo;It was always you,
dear, never Leigh, that I cared for. He was with
me because&mdash;because Nina Potter and I were together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A low whistle escaped Rodgers. &ldquo;By jove!&rdquo; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>exclaimed. &ldquo;I did hear some time ago that Leigh
was attentive to a Miss Underwood&mdash;it never
dawned on me that she was the one who married
Ben Potter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know Leigh very well in San Francisco?&rdquo;
asked Kitty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty well, before he entered the army&mdash;civilian
appointment, you know,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I used to
see him frequently at Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; home in San
Francisco. By the way, Ben was a great friend of
hers in those days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, Mrs. Parsons&mdash;?&rdquo; quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;some people thought she might marry
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty smiled. &ldquo;The idea is droll,&rdquo; she commented.
&ldquo;Ben has chosen a much more suitable wife. I cannot
imagine Mrs. Parsons and Ben in love with
each other; they are such opposite natures. But,
dear,&rdquo; turning troubled eyes toward him, &ldquo;you say
Mrs. Parsons and Leigh were good friends&mdash;there&rsquo;s
something I must tell you. Just vague suspicions,&rdquo;
she hesitated. &ldquo;I cannot bear to be disloyal&mdash;to
harbor suspicions against a man I have called my
friend, but&mdash;&rdquo; she took from her pocket a piece of
mauve-colored paper&mdash;&ldquo;I lunched with Leigh to-day
at the Shoreham and our waiter slipped this
paper into his hand. Leigh carelessly dropped it on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>my doorstep, and not realizing what I was doing,
I read it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rodgers took the paper and, holding it under the
dash-light, peered at the writing. &ldquo;Leigh, you are
watched,&rdquo; he read the words aloud and then reversed
the paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing else on it,&rdquo; Kitty explained.
&ldquo;But the message is in Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; handwriting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the darkness Kitty failed to see Rodgers&rsquo; odd
expression. After waiting vainly for some comment,
she added, &ldquo;Do you suppose that Mrs. Parsons
suspects Leigh is in some way responsible for
Aunt Susan&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That might be inferred.&rdquo; Rodgers folded the
paper and placed it carefully in his leather wallet.
&ldquo;With your permission, I&rsquo;ll keep this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Ted.&rdquo; Kitty put her foot on the self-starter.
&ldquo;I am only too thankful to give it to you and
to have you, dear, to confide in.&rdquo; He returned her
warm handclasp with a grip that hurt. &ldquo;But, Ted,
how is it that Mrs. Parsons knows that the police are
watching Leigh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The police?&rdquo; echoed Rodgers. &ldquo;Oh, ah, yes.
Perhaps she has had another call from Inspector
Mitchell; I saw him coming away from there yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why in the world should he confide in Mrs.
Parsons?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo; Rodgers was frowning in the
darkness, and Kitty, intent on starting the car, did
not notice the alteration in his voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
why any one puts trust in Mrs. Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Ted!&rdquo; Kitty looked at him in surprise. &ldquo;I
never knew you disliked Mrs. Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no use for her,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I never
did like cats&mdash;even your Mouchette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Imagine putting Mrs. Parsons in a class with
Mouchette,&rdquo; Kitty chuckled, then grew grave. &ldquo;Ted,
you don&rsquo;t suppose, really suppose, that Leigh could
have killed Aunt Susan, a defenceless old lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a serpent&rsquo;s tongue.&rdquo; The words were no
sooner spoken than Rodgers regretted them. &ldquo;Forgive
me, darling&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know poor Aunt Susan was not loved&mdash;.&rdquo; A
sigh escaped Kitty. &ldquo;Can it be that Aunt Susan
quarreled with Leigh over his father&rsquo;s treatment of
her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; Rodgers&rsquo; tone was grave. &ldquo;But so
far we do not even know that Leigh was at your
house on Sunday afternoon. Don&rsquo;t brood over the
tragedy, Kitty: forget it, for to-night, at least.
Here&rsquo;s a clear stretch of road ahead&mdash;step on the
gas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instinctively, Kitty followed his suggestion and
the car shot ahead. The wind fanned their cheeks
through the opened windshield, and Kitty was con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>scious
of a feeling of exhilaration as they tore onward,
gathering speed with each throb of the powerful
engine. In the distance Kitty descried a car approaching
and dimmed her headlights. The courtesy
was not returned; instead a spotlight swung
directly on them and Kitty, blinded by the glare,
swerved to the right as the oncoming car swept up.
She heard a deafening report, something swished
by her, and the car raced up the road they had just
traversed.</p>

<p>Checking the speed of her own car, Kitty swung
it back into the center of the road and turned, white-lipped,
to Rodgers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare they drive like that!&rdquo; she gasped.
&ldquo;They must be drunk or cra&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice failed
her at sight of Rodgers sitting huddled back in the
car&mdash;there was something unnatural in his pose
which chilled the blood in her veins. &ldquo;Ted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her call met with no response.</p>

<p>Slowly she put out her hand and touched his
shoulder; then her hand crept upward to his face
and forehead. What she touched felt moist and
sticky. She jerked her hand downward so that the
light from the dash-lamp fell upon it. It was covered
with blood.</p>

<p>There was a sound of a thousand Niagaras roaring
in her ears as she brought the roadster to a
standstill and turned to Rodgers. Bending down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>she pressed her ear over his heart&mdash;its feeble beat
reassured her&mdash;he was still alive.</p>

<p>Kitty searched frantically for her handkerchief
and for his. Tying them together she bound his
wound as best she could; then with compressed lips
and in breathless haste she started the car headlong
for Washington. As they tore madly down the
road, one question only throbbed through her aching
head:</p>

<p>Who had shot her lover?</p>

&ldquo;K. B.&rdquo;</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">nspector Mitchell</span> looked at the policeman
standing in front of his desk with
approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done well, Donovan,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly at what hour was Major Leigh Wallace
seen leaving &lsquo;Rose Hill&rsquo; on Sunday afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Murray claims that it was about five
o&rsquo;clock or a little after,&rdquo; Donovan replied, consulting
his notes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why hasn&rsquo;t she reported this before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been ill with the grippe, and all news of the
murder was kept from her,&rdquo; the policeman answered.
&ldquo;She told her boy to-day, after learning
about Miss Baird&rsquo;s death, to watch for me when I
was on my beat. I went over to see her the moment
my relief came. It wasn&rsquo;t an hour ago,&rdquo; looking at
the office clock which registered half-past nine, &ldquo;Mrs.
Murray said she would be glad to talk to you to-morrow,
but to-night she feels too weak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is her house?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The one next to the Baird mansion on the east&mdash;this
way&mdash;&rdquo; Donovan moved his hands about to
demonstrate his sense of direction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the house
you have to pass to return to Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was Major Wallace in his car on Sunday afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, he was walking.&rdquo; Donovan waited a
moment before adding, &ldquo;Mrs. Murray swears she
knows Major Wallace well by sight; that she&rsquo;s seen
him too often waiting for Miss Kitty Baird to be
mistaken. She was just stepping into her front walk
when the Major brushed by her in such a devil of a
hurry that he nearly knocked her down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell closed the drawers of his desk, locked
them, and arose. &ldquo;That is all now, Donovan,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Report at once if you obtain any further
information. Don&rsquo;t wait to come in person, telephone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Inspector,&rdquo; and saluting, Donovan
hurried away. The door had hardly closed after
him before it opened to admit a plain clothes detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Welsh, what luck?&rdquo; Mitchell asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An old colored man did board the three o&rsquo;clock
train this afternoon for Front Royal, Inspector,&rdquo;
he reported. &ldquo;The gatekeeper and one of the por<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>ters
declared that he answered the description you
furnished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was a woman with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; not that I can find out. Every one
swears that the old man was alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell considered the answer in silence. &ldquo;There
is nothing for it but a trip to Front Royal,&rdquo; he said
finally. &ldquo;Go there, Welsh, and find out if Oscar
Jackson arrived there to-day on the <i>three o&rsquo;clock</i>
train&mdash;no later train, mind you&mdash;from Washington.
I understood Mr. Rodgers to say that Oscar is from
Front Royal and has relatives living in its vicinity.
Therefore he is known and I don&rsquo;t anticipate that
you will have difficulty in locating him. Keep me
informed by telephone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, Inspector.&rdquo; Welsh paused half way
to the door as a thought struck him. &ldquo;Did you get
a message from Mr. Benjamin Potter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. What did he want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say.&rdquo; Welsh again started for the
door. &ldquo;Just asked to have you call him up. Wasn&rsquo;t
his wife one of the witnesses at the Baird inquest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was&mdash;&rdquo; Mitchell was already reaching for
the telephone directory. &ldquo;As you go out, Welsh,
tell Allen to bring my car around at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Getting the Potter apartment on the telephone was
more difficult than Mitchell expected; the naturalist
used a private wire and it was only by virtue of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>office that Mitchell was supplied with the number by
&ldquo;Information.&rdquo; Another wait ensued as Central
claimed the wire &ldquo;busy,&rdquo; and it was with perceptible
irritation that the Inspector answered the hoarse,
&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; that finally responded to his repeated calls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I speak to Mr. Potter?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Potter is out&mdash;&rdquo; a violent cough interrupted
the speaker. &ldquo;Is there any message?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is speaking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Potter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, Madam.&rdquo; Mitchell moderated his
voice. &ldquo;This is Detective Headquarters&mdash;Inspector
Mitchell on the &rsquo;phone. Your husband left word for
me to telephone to him. Do you know what he
wished?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The curtness of her tone annoyed Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will your husband return?&rdquo; he asked,
raising his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very soon, I imagine.&rdquo; There was a pause, and
Mitchell concluded she was consulting her watch,
for she went on, &ldquo;It is nearly ten o&rsquo;clock. Shall I
have Mr. Potter call you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell considered before replying. &ldquo;No. I
may have to go out, so I will ring him up. Thank
you, Madam; good night.&rdquo; He barely caught her
hoarsely echoed &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; before hanging up
the receiver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>Mitchell paused to jot down the Potters&rsquo; telephone
number in his notebook, then, securing his hat and
overcoat, made for the street. Only pausing to exchange
a hasty greeting with a brother officer, he
jumped into the police car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Baird house in Georgetown, Allen,&rdquo; he
directed, and sat in impatient silence as they whirled
through the city streets. He was tired of inaction.
Whatever the hour he could not rest until he had
interviewed Kitty Baird. Mitchell had gained his
promotion to inspector through ability, backed by
dogged determination. He had early decided that
the mystery of Miss Baird&rsquo;s murder could best be
solved through watching Kitty Baird and, as he had
expressed it earlier that evening to Coroner Penfield,
&ldquo;wringing the truth from her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She benefited by her aunt&rsquo;s death and, by heaven,
she is the only one living who did,&rdquo; he had declared.
&ldquo;And it stands one hundred to one that if she doesn&rsquo;t
actually know who bumped her aunt off, she can
make a mighty accurate guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell&rsquo;s temper did not cool down on his arrival
at &ldquo;Rose Hill,&rdquo; but on the contrary gathered heat
as he stood before the front door and rang the bell
with increasing vigor as the minutes lengthened.
The door was finally opened a tiny bit, and through
the crack a pair of beady black eyes peered at him
in the uncertain light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s dar?&rdquo; demanded Mandy, her trembling
tones belying her belligerent attitude as she braced
herself so as to shut the door in case the caller
pushed against it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inspector Mitchell,&rdquo; the latter announced briefly.
&ldquo;Let me in, Mandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly the door was pulled open, but it was not
until the old servant could distinguish Mitchell&rsquo;s
features with the aid of the hall light that she
stepped aside and allowed him to enter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What yo&rsquo; want?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see Miss Kitty Baird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this time o&rsquo; night?&rdquo; in scandalized surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right about the hour,&rdquo; with marked
impatience. &ldquo;Go tell her I am here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mandy wavered&mdash;the power of the law as represented
by a policeman, not to mention an inspector,
loomed large in her vision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Kitty am out,&rdquo; she announced briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this hour?&rdquo; Mitchell smiled skeptically. &ldquo;Go
call her, Mandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed I&rsquo;se tellin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; de truff,&rdquo; she protested.
&ldquo;She went out wif Mister Edward Rodgers early in
de evenin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; she ain&rsquo;t come back, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;se been
awaitin&rsquo; up fo&rsquo; her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell stared at Mandy, then, putting out his
hand, shut the front door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to bed,&rdquo; he said, not unkindly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait
here and let Miss Baird in when she returns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mandy did not budge. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; means well,&rdquo;
she said, somewhat mollified. &ldquo;But I cain&rsquo;t go to
bed &rsquo;till Miss Kitty gets in. If yo&rsquo; care to set awhile,
come right in to de lib&rsquo;ry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell stopped her as she turned to go down the
hall. &ldquo;Let me stay in the parlor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can
see Miss Baird and Mr. Rodgers when they drive
up. I wish to speak to Mr. Rodgers as well as Miss
Baird, and he may leave without entering the
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mandy retraced her steps to a closed door. &ldquo;De
parlor&rsquo;s been kep&rsquo; shut up so long I &rsquo;spects yo&rsquo;ll
freeze,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Dar ain&rsquo;t much heat comes in
hyar from de furnace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right; I&rsquo;ll keep on my overcoat.&rdquo; Mitchell
stepped briskly into the room. &ldquo;Let me light
the gas, Mandy,&rdquo; as the old servant fumbled with
the gas fixture, stiffened from lack of use. &ldquo;Run
along, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; but Mandy lingered by the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be up in Miss Kitty&rsquo;s bedroom&mdash;jes&rsquo; fetch a yell ef
yo&rsquo; needs me, Mister Inspector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he listened to Mandy&rsquo;s halting footsteps growing
fainter and fainter as she climbed wearily upstairs,
Mitchell contemplated the large square room
filled with &ldquo;period&rdquo; furniture. The old brocades
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>were shabby and the rugs worn, but there was an
indefinable atmosphere of the refinement of a bygone
generation which time and neglect had not destroyed.</p>

<p>Mitchell raised the shades in the windows overlooking
Q Street and peered outside. No automobile
except his own, waiting at the curb, was in
sight. Satisfied on that point, he opened the window
ever so slightly that he might be sure and hear
a car drive up to the door, and then, to occupy his
time, he wandered about the room and examined the
many pieces of bric-a-brac on the mantel and in
cabinets.</p>

<p>One cabinet in particular attracted his attention.
It was a fine piece of Florentine workmanship and
remarkably well preserved. The floor of the cabinet
held miniatures of, presumably, ancestors of Miss
Susan Baird, and after a cursory glance at them,
Mitchell scanned the articles on the glass shelves.
A set of carved ivory chessmen awoke his admiration
and observing that the key was in the door of
the cabinet he opened it. After examining the little
chessmen, he turned his attention to the ivory checkers
and then to the two ivory cups for holding dice.
The carving on them was very fine and to see them
better Mitchell carried them to the gas light.</p>

<p>Glancing at the red dice cup, he was surprised to
find cotton stuffed inside it. Setting down the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>cup, Mitchell pulled out the layer of cotton and
found a small bottle standing upright. It was held
in the center of the cup by cotton packed around it.
Drawing out the bottle he held it up to the light. It
was almost empty. Mitchell pulled out the glass
stopper and sniffed at the contents. A distinct smell
of bitter almonds caused him to draw in his breath
sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prussic acid!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;By God! And
Miss Susan Baird was poisoned with a dose of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no label on the small phial. Taking
out his handkerchief Mitchell replaced the glass
stopper, and wrapped his handkerchief about the
phial. Putting it carefully in his pocket, he paused
for a moment to take another look at the dice cups,
then replaced them in the cabinet. He and two of
his assistants had made a complete and searching
examination of the parlor immediately after the discovery
of the crime. Mitchell was willing to swear
that neither cotton nor phial had been in the dice cup
then. Who had hidden the incriminating evidence
there? Who had had the opportunity to do so?
Kitty Baird....</p>

<p>Mitchell frowned heavily as he ran over in his
mind the list of callers at the Baird home since the
tragedy became known. The house was under surveillance
and he felt confident no one had evaded
the watchful eyes of his operatives. He dismissed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>the majority of callers&mdash;friends and acquaintances
who had left cards and letters of condolence&mdash;and
his thoughts centered on those whom old Oscar had
admitted&mdash;Charles Craige, Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin
Potter, Edward Rodgers, and Major Leigh Wallace&mdash;but
to the best of his knowledge the Major had
<i>not</i> been inside the Baird house. He had seen Kitty
and Wallace arrive that afternoon, but Wallace had
departed without entering; therefore, he could not
have had an opportunity to secrete the bottle of
poison in the ivory dice cup.</p>

<p>But Mitchell&rsquo;s puzzled expression did not lighten,
instead it deepened. He was wrong, Wallace had
been in the house after the discovery of the murder,
for he had accompanied Dr. Leonard McLean to the
house on Monday morning. Could the young officer
have slipped unseen into the parlor and concealed
the bottle of poison while he, Mitchell, and Coroner
Penfield were superintending the removal of Miss
Baird&rsquo;s body from the library to her bedroom?</p>

<p>Bah! the idea was absurd. A man would not return
to the scene of a murder with incriminating
evidence in his pocket when he had had hours in
which to throw away the poison without arousing
suspicion. But supposing Wallace had, in the horror
of the moment, forgotten the bottle? Mitchell
shook his head in disbelief. Whoever perpetrated
so cold-blooded and premeditated a crime was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>apt to overlook getting rid of the poison at the first
opportunity.</p>

<p>With Wallace eliminated, Mitchell turned his
thoughts to Kitty&rsquo;s other callers&mdash;Ben Potter and
his pretty wife, and Charles Craige, the brilliant
lawyer and popular clubman. Mitchell smiled
broadly&mdash;no possible motive linked them in any way,
shape or manner with the crime. Edward Rodgers&mdash;Mitchell
frowned as Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; confidences recurred
to him. Whatever his connection with the
Holt will case, nothing had occurred to associate
Rodgers with the murder of Miss Baird. The fact
that he was madly in love with her niece was patent
to all, but it did not constitute evidence that he had
a hand in murdering her aunt.</p>

<p>The exhaust from an automobile broke the stillness
and Mitchell paused only long enough at the
window to see that a car had stopped near his. The
next second he was hurrying down the terraced
steps, his mind made up. Kitty had quarreled with
her aunt on Sunday afternoon; she had inherited
her wealth, and she had had the greatest opportunity
to slip the bottle of prussic acid into its hiding place
unknown to any one. There were questions which
Kitty alone could answer, and she must answer them
immediately.</p>

<p>As Mitchell hurried to the side of the automobile,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>its owner stepped on the running board and faced
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Potter!&rdquo; exclaimed Mitchell. &ldquo;Did they tell
you at Headquarters that I was here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter peered at him in uncertainty for a second.
&ldquo;Oh, Inspector,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you, but
I had no idea you were here. The fact is,&rdquo; lowering
his voice as Allen, tired of waiting in Mitchell&rsquo;s car,
climbed out on the sidewalk and drew near the two
men. &ldquo;My wife called up Miss Baird and couldn&rsquo;t
get an answer. We both felt concerned about my
cousin and I ran over to see if anything was the matter.
Why are you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to talk to Miss Baird,&rdquo; Mitchell answered.
&ldquo;However, she is out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out? At this hour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Mandy told me that she was motoring
with Mr. Rodgers,&rdquo; explained Mitchell. &ldquo;I decided
to wait for her return, and when you drove up, I
thought it was Mr. Rodgers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter&rsquo;s expression hardened. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t approve
of Kitty going out at night with Rodgers without a
chaperon,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Nor is it proper for her
to live in this lonely house with only ignorant servants.&rdquo;
He turned back to his car and lifted out a
camera and several packages. &ldquo;Kitty left these at
our apartment on Saturday, and Nina asked me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>bring them to her before the chemicals get mixed
with mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chemicals,&rdquo; repeated Mitchell softly. &ldquo;What
kind of chemicals?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For developing negatives.&rdquo; Potter started for
the house and Mitchell kept pace with him. &ldquo;Kitty
has quite a craze that way&mdash;does good work for an
amateur. Some of her animal studies are excellent,
especially of her cat, Mouchette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me there are quite a number of poisons
used in developing films and negatives,&rdquo; Mitchell
remarked thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, get all you want at a kodak shop. Kitty
bought a new supply last Saturday,&rdquo; Potter replied
carelessly. &ldquo;Good Lord! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exclamation was drawn from him by the
sound of a motor horn which grew in volume as the
car approached nearer and both men looked down
Q Street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! Some one&rsquo;s breaking the law!&rdquo; exclaimed
Allen, attracted by the oncoming car whose headlights
brightened the whole street.</p>

<p>With a grinding of brakes and totally regardless
of stopping on the wrong side of the street, the
driver drew up to the curb close to the three men
and Mitchell recognized Kitty Baird sitting behind
the steering wheel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, quick!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;<i>Quick!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Kitty!&rdquo; Potter sprang to her side. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
wrong, child? What&rsquo;s happened? Don&rsquo;t look so
terrified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ted has been shot!&rdquo; Kitty was on the sidewalk
and around the car with lightning speed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
stand there talking&mdash;help me carry Ted into my
house and then go for a doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell brushed her unceremoniously aside and
looked in the car. The sight of Rodgers&rsquo; unconscious
form called for action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, Allen,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Take hold&mdash;gently,
man, gently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed an age to Kitty before the three men
carried their burden up the long terraced steps and
into the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go up to the bedroom at the head of the stairs,&rdquo;
she directed. &ldquo;Mandy,&rdquo; to the colored woman who,
aroused by the noise of tramping feet and voices,
appeared at the top of the staircase. &ldquo;Show them
into the spare bedroom and help them get the bed
ready for Mr. Rodgers. I&rsquo;ll telephone at once for
Dr. McLean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Kitty stood with clenched
hands waiting for the surgeon&rsquo;s verdict. She had
paced the hall until physical exhaustion had called a
halt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he live, doctor?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>me in suspense.&rdquo; And the agony in her eyes caused
McLean to hurry his usually slow speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if there are no complications&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty waited to hear no more. Turning abruptly,
she stumbled toward her own room&mdash;she could not
face any one just then. She had reached the end of
endurance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Baird,&rdquo; Mitchell&rsquo;s stern voice caused her
to falter just outside her bedroom door. &ldquo;Who
shot Edward Rodgers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;We were coming
home through Rock Creek Park and a car
dashed by us. I was blinded by its headlights. I
heard a report&mdash;&rdquo; she caught her breath sharply.
&ldquo;I turned and found Mr. Rodgers sitting unconscious&mdash;wounded
as you found him. I brought him
home&mdash;ah, I can&rsquo;t talk to you now&mdash;go&mdash;go!&rdquo; And
she half walked, half staggered across the threshold
of her bedroom and into Mandy&rsquo;s sympathetic arms.</p>

<p>Mitchell went slowly downstairs and out into the
street. Allen, his chauffeur, was standing by Edward
Rodgers&rsquo; car, and at sight of the inspector
waved a beckoning hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, Sir,&rdquo; he said, turning the rays of his
electric torch into the body of the roadster. &ldquo;See
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell stared at the revolver for several seconds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>It lay just under the gear shift. Putting on his
gloves, Mitchell picked it up gingerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you handled the revolver, Allen?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. After the doctor and the nurse came, I
returned here and put out the headlights which Miss
Baird had left burning; then I saw the revolver
lying just there on the floor of the car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A step behind him caused Mitchell to turn around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, what have you there?&rdquo; asked Ben Potter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A revolver.&rdquo; Mitchell held it so that Allen&rsquo;s
torch fell directly upon it. &ldquo;And a revolver which
has been recently discharged judging from the smell
of burnt powder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter whistled, then bent down for a better look.
&ldquo;By heaven!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Kitty&rsquo;s revolver.
I had her initials engraved upon it&mdash;see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And turning the revolver slightly, Mitchell was
able to decipher the letters on the plate: &ldquo;K.B.&rdquo;</p>

ELUSIVE CLUES</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">nspector Mitchell</span> felt extremely
pleased with himself as he hurried along Seventeenth
Street in the direction of the Munitions
Building. In his interview with Mrs. Augustus
Murray of Georgetown, an hour before, he had been
unable to shake her confidence in her claim that she
had met Major Leigh Wallace leaving the Baird
mansion on Sunday afternoon about five minutes
past five o&rsquo;clock. Mrs. Murray supplemented her
original statement with the information that the
Major never had the decency to apologize to her,
when he ran against her in his blind haste.</p>

<p>Upon leaving Mrs. Murray, Inspector Mitchell
went at once to Major Wallace&rsquo;s boarding house
where he learned that he had missed the young officer
by ten minutes only.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to the Army Dispensary in the Munitions
Building for treatment,&rdquo; Mrs. Harris, the
landlady, informed him. &ldquo;Dear knows, I hope the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>treatment does him some good. The way he moans
in his sleep is something awful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, is Major Wallace troubled with insomnia?&rdquo;
asked Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s troubled with.&rdquo; Mrs.
Harris was not blessed with an even temper, and
when it was aroused generally vented her ill-humor
on the first person encountered. &ldquo;His room is next
to mine and the partition is mighty thin. It makes
my flesh crawl to hear him moan and when he cries
out, &lsquo;Kitty!&rsquo; and again, &lsquo;That damned cat,&rsquo; I just
have to pound on the wall and wake him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he has an antipathy to cats,&rdquo; remarked
Mitchell, restraining a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe he has; anyway I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m sorry
he&rsquo;s going&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out west somewhere,&rdquo; vaguely. &ldquo;If you hurry
you may catch Major Wallace at the Dispensary;
he&rsquo;s usually there about two hours.&rdquo; And taking
the broad hint Mitchell bowed himself out of the
boarding house.</p>

<p>Unable to secure a taxicab at the Dupont Circle
stand in place of the police car and Allen, whom he
had sent on an errand earlier in the morning, Mitchell
boarded a southbound street car and, standing
on the forward platform, kept a sharp look-out for
Major Wallace. He reached the corner of H Street,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>however, without catching up with him, and leaving
the car continued on down Seventeenth Street.</p>

<p>So absorbed was Inspector Mitchell in his own
thoughts that he failed to return Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; bow
as her motor passed him on its way up the street.
At a word from Mrs. Parsons, her chauffeur swung
the touring car around and up to the curb just as
Mitchell started to cross D Street. The sound of
his name caused him to glance around and he saw
Mrs. Parsons beckoning to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I give you a lift, Inspector?&rdquo; she asked as
he approached. &ldquo;You appear to be in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Mitchell wasted no superfluous words
but seated himself with alacrity by Mrs. Parsons&rsquo;
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where to, sir?&rdquo; questioned the chauffeur, touching
his cap as he closed the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Munitions Building&mdash;that is,&rdquo; and Mitchell
turned inquiringly toward Mrs. Parsons, &ldquo;if it won&rsquo;t
take you out of your way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; smile was most engaging.
&ldquo;The car and I are at your service, Inspector.
I have no engagements this morning.&rdquo; She
paused to wave her hand to the occupants of a passing
car, then turned once more to the silent inspector.
&ldquo;Has anything new developed in the Baird
murder mystery?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Only what was in the morning newspapers,&rdquo;
answered Mitchell guardedly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; gay laugh interrupted him. &ldquo;I applaud
your caution,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The morning newspapers
contained no news whatever. Perhaps my
question was overstepping etiquette, but how about
the other matter about which I consulted you? I
mean Edward Rodgers and his erstwhile friend,
Major Leigh Wallace. What of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell considered the pretty widow before replying.
Her limpid brown eyes were raised to his
with an appealing earnestness that was irresistible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am on my way to see Major Wallace now,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I had hoped to overtake him before he
reached the Munitions Building.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not by walking, surely,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Major
Wallace is driving his car to-day and he seldom
keeps within the city&rsquo;s speed limit. And to-day was
no exception judging from the way he passed me
on the way downtown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; He turned so that he could face her
as they talked. &ldquo;His landlady informed me that
Major Wallace plans to leave shortly for the west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons raised her eyebrows in polite surprise.
&ldquo;So soon,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;How odd!
And&mdash;&rdquo; her voice gained in sharpness, &ldquo;does Edward
Rodgers also plan to leave Washington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he <i>had</i> planned,&rdquo; with quiet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>emphasis. &ldquo;But he is not going anywhere just
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he was shot last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; convulsive jump almost precipitated
her out of the car as the chauffeur made the
turn into the street leading to the Munitions Building.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what did you say?&rdquo; she stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to startle you,&rdquo; Mitchell spoke
contritely, alarmed by her pallor. &ldquo;I thought that
you had heard the news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard nothing&mdash;&rdquo; she spoke rapidly, clipping
her words. &ldquo;There was nothing in the morning
paper&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t give it out to the press.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how did you expect me to know anything
of the shooting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought Miss Kitty Baird might have telephoned
to you&mdash;&rdquo; Mitchell was watching her closely.
&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons sat back more comfortably
in her car. &ldquo;Was Mr. Rodgers killed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell shook his head. &ldquo;Seriously injured,&rdquo; he
said soberly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did the shooting occur?&rdquo; she asked. The
car had stopped before the lower entrance to the
Munitions Building, but Mrs. Parsons motioned to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>her chauffeur to wait as he started to open the car
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, some one was skylarking in Rock Creek
Park and shot Mr. Rodgers as he and Miss Kitty
Baird were motoring home last night,&rdquo; explained
Mitchell. &ldquo;Another case of an innocent bystander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> an accident, then.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons raised
her scented handkerchief and touched her lips. &ldquo;I
thought&mdash;it just occurred to me that he might have
tried suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell regarded her fixedly for a second. &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t a great admiration for Edward Rodgers,&rdquo;
he remarked dryly. &ldquo;No, it was <i>not</i> a case of suicide.&rdquo;
He stepped to the sidewalk. &ldquo;Thanks very
much, Mrs. Parsons, for bringing me down. Good
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons controlled her impulse to stop him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; she answered, and her voice
was honey sweet, but her chauffeur, happening to
meet her glance, quailed at the flash of rage which
darkened her eyes and then was gone. &ldquo;&lsquo;Rose Hill,&rsquo;
Perkins.&rdquo; The sharp command caused him to thank
his stars that he had left his engine running. Mrs.
Parsons&rsquo; uncertain temper had not endeared her to
her servants.</p>

<p>The trip to Georgetown consumed less than ten
minutes and Mrs. Parsons had assumed her ordinary
expression of tranquil boredom when Perkins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>returned with the message that &ldquo;Miss Baird would
be happy to see Mrs. Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the first time Mrs. Parsons had been to
call upon Kitty since the murder of her aunt, and
she could not repress curious glances about her as
she passed Mandy and went into the familiar library.
She had hardly seated herself before the sound of
a light footstep on the staircase leading down from
the gallery into the library caused her to look up and
she saw Kitty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child!&rdquo; she exclaimed, advancing with
outstretched hands which Kitty grasped while submitting
gracefully to the dainty kiss which accompanied
her greeting. &ldquo;My heart aches for you.
Your face tells me how you have suffered!&rdquo; and she
traced the dark circles under Kitty&rsquo;s eyes with her
finger-tip. &ldquo;Is there nothing I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty did not reply at once; instead she busied
herself in pulling forward a chair. She was given
to acting upon impulse and Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; unexpected
appearance clinched a half-formed resolve
made in the early hours of the morning while watching
by Edward Rodgers&rsquo; bedside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something you can do,&rdquo; she said, and
her smile was very winning. &ldquo;Tell me why you
wrote a note of warning to Leigh Wallace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question was unexpected and Mrs. Parsons
was taken off her guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He showed it to you!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;How dared
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty watched the color come and go in Mrs.
Parsons&rsquo; white cheeks with interest. It was seldom
that the widow showed emotion. &ldquo;I am waiting for
an answer to my question,&rdquo; she reminded her quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let Leigh Wallace supply the answer.&rdquo; Mrs.
Parsons had herself in hand again. &ldquo;He can&mdash;if he
has not already left town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty did her best to repress a start, but the keen
eyes watching her under half-closed lids detected it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we leave Leigh out of the question,&rdquo;
Kitty controlled her voice admirably. &ldquo;Would you
rather answer me or the police?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The police?&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons laughed tolerantly.
&ldquo;Dear child, the strain you have been under distorts
your ideas. Why the police?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because they are endeavoring to solve the mystery
of my aunt&rsquo;s murder.&rdquo; Kitty nothing daunted
by the older woman&rsquo;s evasions was determined to
fight in the open. &ldquo;I am convinced, Mrs. Parsons,
that Leigh&mdash;and you&mdash;have a guilty knowledge of
that crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only the most astute observer could have translated
the swift change in Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; expression.
Even to Kitty&rsquo;s prejudiced ears her low amused
laugh rang true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You have dug up a mare&rsquo;s nest,&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons
replied. &ldquo;To think that you should consider that I
had a hand in poor, dear Miss Susan&rsquo;s death! Why,
my dear, it would be insulting if it was not ludicrous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty flushed with wrath; Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; ridicule
was hard to bear. After all, was the widow right&mdash;had
she dug up a mare&rsquo;s nest? There was nothing
but that note of warning to Leigh Wallace to connect
her in the slightest degree with the tragedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me to what your note referred,&rdquo;
she asked, &ldquo;if not to my aunt&rsquo;s murder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You overstep my patience.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons drew
herself up with a displeased gesture. &ldquo;I decline to
be questioned further on the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Baird&mdash;&rdquo; the interruption came from the
doorway and both Kitty and her guest whirled
around to see a white-capped nurse watching them.
&ldquo;Mr. Rodgers keeps calling for you. Will you come,
please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, immediately.&rdquo; Kitty was half way to the
door when Mrs. Parsons addressed her with eagerness
in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Rodgers here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s impatience was marked. &ldquo;We
brought him here after the&mdash;the accident. Dr. McLean
thought it best not to move him to a hospital.
Please don&rsquo;t detain me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons paused just in
front of her. &ldquo;Are you here alone&mdash;unchaperoned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cousin, Nina Potter, came last night to be
with me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am relieved,&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons purred out the
words. &ldquo;No one can afford to defy the conventions.
If your cousin was not here, I would volunteer myself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks&mdash;excuse me, Mrs. Parsons&mdash;&rdquo; The
portières opened and closed behind her vanishing
figure and Mrs. Parsons found herself alone in the
library.</p>

<p>Raising her gold lorgnette Mrs. Parsons took a
prolonged survey of the throne-shaped chair standing
in its customary place behind the tea table. It
required but little stretch of the imagination to visualize
Miss Susan Baird presiding over the tea cups,
her hawklike nose and piercing eyes. In spite of
the warmth of the library, Mrs. Parsons shivered
and drew her costly fur coat more closely about her.</p>

<p>With some hesitancy she approached the tea table
and scanned the antique silver tea service. She had
admired it on many occasions. Taking up the teapot
she reversed it and tried to decipher the hall
mark; failing to do so she examined first the cream
pitcher and then the sugar bowl. As she lowered the
bowl, she glanced across the tea table and saw two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>large yellow eyes regarding her from the throne-shaped
chair.</p>

<p>Mouchette stood in the chair with her fore-paws
resting on the table and her fluffy tail was lashing
itself into a fury. It was the cat&rsquo;s evident intention
to spring upon the table and Mrs. Parsons retreated
precipitously. She hated cats. As she passed the
table, she dropped the sugar bowl on its polished
surface. The bowl skidded, half righted itself, then
fell to the floor, the heavy rug deadening the noise.
With it went a small object unseen by Mrs. Parsons
who, not stopping to pick up the bowl, proceeded
into the hall.</p>

<p>Mouchette, surprised by Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; rapid retreat,
stood where she was for an instant, then
jumped lightly to the floor and sniffed at the sugar
bowl. Going over to the small object lying by the
bowl she sniffed at that, stretched out an inquisitive
paw, gave it a gentle pat, watched it roll a short distance,
then convinced that she had a plaything after
her own heart, the cat proceeded to roll it hither and
yon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons was making straight for the front
door when she caught sight of some one in the parlor,
the door of which stood ajar. With a quiet air
of authority she entered the room. So silently did
she move that not until Nina Potter turned away
from the Florentine cabinet was she aware of Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>Parsons&rsquo; presence. The ivory chessman which she
held slipped from her fingers and shattered on the
hardwood floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a pity!&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; air of concern
sat prettily upon her. &ldquo;My dear Nina, did I startle
you? I am so distressed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; admitted Nina with a rueful smile.
&ldquo;The quinine I have taken for my cold has made me
quite deaf. Does Kitty know that you are here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just seen her,&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons selected a
chair and motioned Nina to one beside it. She did
not propose to have her call cut short. She had
found her source of information. &ldquo;Kitty had to go
upstairs to be with Edward Rodgers. When did
the shooting occur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Late last night.&rdquo; Nina moved uneasily; she
knew Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; predilection for scandal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where&mdash;&rdquo; with gentle insistence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Rock Creek Park.&rdquo; Nina&rsquo;s hoarse voice
rasped Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; ears. She was sensitive to
sound. &ldquo;Ben was here when Kitty returned with
Ted Rodgers, and he came right home and brought
me back to stay with Kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons eyed her in silence, noting every
detail of her pretty morning dress as well as the
unusual redness of her eyelids and the nervous
twitching of her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How fortunate for you,&rdquo; she exclaimed. Nina
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>looked up and caught her eyes; for a moment their
glances held, then Nina looked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t catch your meaning,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;&mdash;with a rising inflection which implied
doubt, and Nina blushed painfully. Mrs. Parsons
avoided looking at her; instead she inspected the
furniture in the parlor and shuddered. &ldquo;Such taste
in decoration,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;But then Kitty
can change all that with the fortune Miss Susan
Baird left to her. What a sensation the news of her
wealth has made in Washington! Has no one asked
<i>you</i> how Miss Baird acquired it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nina&rsquo;s color slowly ebbed away. The eyes she
turned on Mrs. Parsons were like some hunted animal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you know?&rdquo; she stammered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons nodded her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confide in me, my dear Nina,&rdquo; she spoke with a
world of sympathy in voice and manner. &ldquo;I know
that I can aid you.&rdquo;</p>

SUSPICION</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> was not often that Charles Craige was late in
keeping an appointment with Mrs. Parsons.
But the pretty widow had occasion to glance
repeatedly at her parlor clock with ever increasing
annoyance before she heard the butler ushering
some one upstairs. She masked her displeasure
under a smiling face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Charles, what has detained you?&rdquo; she asked,
as he bent low over her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pressing business,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I am deeply
sorry to be late, Cecelia. Judge McMasters simply
would not hurry. Has Ben Potter been here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to-day.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; surprise at the question
was manifest. &ldquo;You know he is not one of my
favorites. He bored me to death in San Francisco;
he is so intense&mdash;&rdquo; she shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;I
saw his wife this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; Craige selected a cigarette from the
box on the table and accepted a lighted match.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Silly sentimental little fool,&rdquo; commented Mrs.
Parsons. &ldquo;Just the kind of wife Ben could have
been counted on to pick out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men usually marry to please themselves.&rdquo; Craige
laughed. &ldquo;Ben telephoned me an hour ago and said
that he was coming around to see you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did not state.&rdquo; Craige looked at her in surprise,
abruptness was not usual with her. &ldquo;He may
come at any moment&mdash;&rdquo; glancing at his watch. It
lacked five minutes of the hour. &ldquo;I stopped at the
bank this morning and President Walsh said he
would accept your note for two thousand dollars
provided you have collateral&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons colored deeply. &ldquo;In
fact, I am not sure that I shall need the loan from
the bank. I was only temporarily embarrassed until
my property in San Francisco is sold. To-day,&rdquo; she
paused, &ldquo;I have arranged another matter satisfactorily.
It is kind of you, Charles, very kind, to
handle my business for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dearest Cecelia&mdash;&rdquo; Craige laid his hand on
hers. &ldquo;I am happiest when I serve you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled with a hint of tears. &ldquo;I am
grateful,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You have been so good,
so very good since I came to Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cecelia!&rdquo; Craige bent forward impulsively, but
she drew away from his embrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now, dear,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;You know you
promised&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige&rsquo;s handsome face, alight with eagerness,
altered. &ldquo;I will keep my word&mdash;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One
month, Cecelia, and then the whole world is to know
of my happiness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our happiness&mdash;&rdquo; she corrected softly. Craige
caught her hands and pressed the palms against his
face before kissing them with lingering tenderness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>A la bonne heure!</i>&rdquo; he exclaimed, and his voice
betrayed his happiness. &ldquo;Cecelia, you grow prettier
every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mirror is not so kind as you, Charles!&rdquo; A
sigh accompanied the words, and she swiftly
changed the subject. &ldquo;Have you seen Kitty Baird
to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am on my way there now.&rdquo; A worried
look crossed his face. &ldquo;That poor girl seems
fated for tragedy. You heard of the attempt
to kill Ted Rodgers last night in the Park, did you
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understood that it was an accident.&rdquo; Horror
crept into Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; eyes. &ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kitty declares that the headlights of the car
blinded her, and that she has no idea of the identity
of the person who did the shooting. She says that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>she could not even tell whether it was a man or a
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige, sitting facing the light from the western
window, failed to detect the faint alteration in Mrs.
Parsons&rsquo; expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is Ted Rodgers?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Out of danger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard; which reminds me that I am to
meet Dr. McLean at &lsquo;Rose Hill&rsquo; at three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
Craige rose. &ldquo;I sincerely hope that Ted recovers&mdash;it
will kill Kitty if anything happens to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons held out her hands and Craige
helped her slowly to her feet. &ldquo;So Ted really has
cut out Leigh Wallace in Kitty&rsquo;s affections,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

<p>Craige frowned. &ldquo;It was nothing more than a
flirtation between Kitty and Wallace,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;Her whole heart is centered on Ted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak with positiveness&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons&rsquo;
laugh held a touch of malice. &ldquo;Remember, women
are fickle&mdash;and Leigh very attractive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fail to understand the fascination he apparently
has for women.&rdquo; Craige&rsquo;s tone was stiff. A mischievous
smile touched Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; lips and her
eyes danced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leigh was very, very smitten with Kitty,&rdquo; she
asserted, as she paused before the long gilt mirror
and adjusted her lorgnette chain. &ldquo;Do you suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>it could have been Leigh who tried to kill Ted last
night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige stood just behind her and looking in the
mirror she saw his face reflected over her shoulder.
His expression of surprise gave place to doubt&mdash;to
wonder&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;No, it can&rsquo;t be, Cecelia.
Leigh, whatever his faults, is the type of man who
fights in the open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jealousy changes a man&rsquo;s nature sometimes,&rdquo; she
murmured. &ldquo;Leigh has not been himself since his
return from France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You knew him before, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons nodded. &ldquo;Very slightly. It was
Nina Potter who commented upon the change in
him; he was an old sweetheart of hers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige paused. &ldquo;Upon my word, Cecelia,&rdquo; he
ejaculated. &ldquo;How do you learn so much about
people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed aloud in her amusement. &ldquo;I am observant.
I find&mdash;&rdquo; and the lines about her mouth
hardened&mdash;&ldquo;it pays to be. Will you dine with me
to-morrow night, Charles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; with eager haste. &ldquo;And will you go to
the theater afterward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; She laid her hand for the fraction of
a second against his cheek with a caressing motion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>&ldquo;Careful, dear, James is waiting to open the door
for you&mdash;&rdquo; and Craige perforce contented himself
with a formal handshake as the servant came forward
to the foot of the short flight of steps with his
overcoat and hat.</p>

<p>Craige was about to step into his motor when he
became aware that the butler was at his elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I have a word with you, sir?&rdquo; he asked, and
a jerk of his thumb indicated Craige&rsquo;s chauffeur.
&ldquo;In private, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, James.&rdquo; Mystified by the butler&rsquo;s air
of secretiveness Craige followed him a few steps
down the street. When convinced that the chauffeur
could not overhear them, James halted. But
they were not destined to have their interview in
private, for as Craige stood waiting for James to explain
what he wished Inspector Mitchell stopped beside
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Mr. Craige,&rdquo; he said, as he
nodded a greeting to the butler. &ldquo;Glad to see you,
sir. Now, James, why did you send for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>James rubbed his hands together and cast an appealing
look at Craige. &ldquo;I had to,&rdquo; he began, addressing
his remarks to him rather than to Mitchell.
&ldquo;My conscience couldn&rsquo;t rest easy, sir, after I read
the newspapers about the inquest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The inquest?&rdquo; Mitchell&rsquo;s eyes snapped with ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>citement.
&ldquo;Go on, man&mdash;you mean the Baird inquest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Mr. Craige, sir, the newspapers said that
Miss Baird was killed by poison put on a peach,&rdquo; he
spoke in nervous haste and Craige had some difficulty
in catching what he said. &ldquo;Nobody seemed
to know where the peaches came from &rsquo;cording to
the papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more we did,&rdquo; prompted Mitchell. &ldquo;Well,
what then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>James licked his lips with the tip of his tongue.
&ldquo;Miss Kitty Baird goes to the market sometimes for
Mrs. Parsons, sir. On Saturday she brought back
some California peaches,&rdquo; his voice sank even
lower. &ldquo;She called here Sunday morning, and when
she left, the peaches wasn&rsquo;t on the dining room
table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige stared the butler out of countenance. &ldquo;Preposterous!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, turning red with indignation.
&ldquo;What are you suggesting, James?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir, Mr. Craige. I&rsquo;m just telling you
about the peaches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige&rsquo;s face was a study of wrath and bewilderment;
the former predominating. With an effort,
he checked an oath and instead drew out some loose
silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you spoke only to us, James,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Come with me, Mitchell,&rdquo; and paying no attention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>to the inspector&rsquo;s protests that he wished further
word with the butler, he hurried him toward his car.</p>

<p>So occupied were both men that neither caught
James&rsquo; furtive glance at the parlor window as he
turned to reënter Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; house.</p>

THE FEET OF THE FURTIVE</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">andy</span> was not happy in her mind. No
matter how tempting the dishes she
cooked, her beloved &ldquo;Miss Kitty&rdquo; failed
to eat more than &ldquo;jes&rsquo; scraps,&rdquo; as Mandy expressed
it in her disgust. But Kitty&rsquo;s heart as
well as her thoughts were centered in the sickroom
and she did not linger elsewhere. Weakened
through loss of blood and shock, Ted Rodgers had
lain partly conscious all through the morning, taking
no interest in his surroundings and only rousing
when Kitty spoke to him. But even to her he addressed
no conversation, being content to hold her
hand and gaze at her with his heart in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do go and lie down, Miss Baird.&rdquo; Miss Grey,
the trained nurse, laid a sympathetic hand on Kitty&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;I assure you Mr. Rodgers is better, and
I promise to call you the moment Dr. McLean gets
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty stretched her cramped muscles and looked
at Ted. Even to her inexperienced eyes, he appeared
to be resting more comfortably and his cheeks
were a healthier color. She felt inexplicably weary;
her eyelids were heavy from lack of sleep and her
head ached unmercifully. Taking care not to arouse
Rodgers, Kitty moved away from the bedside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in the room,&rdquo; she told Miss Gray, lowering
her voice, &ldquo;just across the hall, and I will
leave my door open. If you want the slightest thing
just call me, and I will come at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty&rsquo;s desire for &ldquo;forty winks,&rdquo; as her aunt had
always termed her afternoon nap, was not to be
gratified immediately, for as she stepped into the
hall, Mandy came toiling up the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Law, ma&rsquo;am, Miss Kitty!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;Dis
hyar day am gwine to be de ruination of me. I
wish that no-count nigger, Oscar, was hyar attendin&rsquo;
to his work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish so, too!&rdquo; echoed Kitty fervently. &ldquo;Have
you had word from Oscar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, m&rsquo;m.&rdquo; Mandy had a habit of mumbling her
words. &ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s Mrs. Potter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Kitty yawned. &ldquo;In
the library, probably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No she ain&rsquo;t, neither!&rdquo; Mandy&rsquo;s exasperation
was gaining the upper hand. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s been two tele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>phone
calls fo&rsquo; her, an&rsquo; I &rsquo;spects Mister Ben&rsquo;ll
jump clear through his skin if she don&rsquo;t come an&rsquo;
talk to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Ben on the &rsquo;phone now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yessim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to him on the branch &rsquo;phone.&rdquo; Kitty
crossed the hall. &ldquo;You might see if Mrs. Potter is
lying down in the boudoir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The telephone instrument was close by the door
and Kitty, who had earlier in the day deadened the
sound of the bell by stuffing cotton about it, so that
its ring might not disturb Rodgers, took off the receiver.
No masculine voice answered her low hail,
and finally, convinced that her cousin must have
grown tired and rung off, she hung up the receiver.
Going over to her bed she threw herself fully
dressed upon it, and in a few minutes her even
breathing showed that she had fallen into the heavy
slumber of utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>Mandy, left to her own devices, wandered down
the hall to the boudoir. It was located next to the
bedroom which had belonged to Miss Susan Baird.
The old colored woman cautiously poked her head
inside the door sufficiently for to convince herself
that the boudoir was empty, then withdrew. She
stood for some seconds before the closed door leading
into &ldquo;Miss Susan&rsquo;s&rdquo; bedroom, but her superstitious
dread kept her from entering it. Had she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>done so she would have found the object of her
search.</p>

<p>Nina Potter, her ear close to the key-hole of the
door, heard Mandy stump heavily away and drew
a long, long breath of relief. Getting up from her
knees, she looked about the room. It had been left
untouched since the funeral, Mandy not having
found courage either to dust or sweep, or, for the
matter of that, to enter it upon any occasion whatever,
in spite of Kitty&rsquo;s directions to put the bedroom
in order.</p>

<p>It was a large room with high ceilings and diamond-paned
windows. The shades were raised
and the afternoon sunshine fell full upon the carved
four-post bedstead with its time-worn canopy and
broad valance. Going over to the bureau, Nina
tried the different drawers; they were all unlocked.
Turning once again to convince herself that she
really was alone in the room, she waited a second
and then went through the bureau with neatness and
dispatch. Her search was unproductive of result.
Nothing daunted, she examined the old desk with
equal thoroughness, and then turned her attention
to the mahogany wardrobe which occupied one corner
of the room. She found that it contained nothing
but clothes which a generation before had been
fashionable. They hung on the wooden pegs, rainbow
hued, beribboned, and musty. Nina hastily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>closed the doors and turned her back on the wardrobe.</p>

<p>The action brought her face to face with the bedstead.
It was the only piece of furniture in the
room which she had not examined. With some hesitancy
she walked over to it. The sheets had been
spread neatly over the mattress, but the bolster and
pillows had evidently been tossed in place, for they
had assumed grotesque shapes and to her excited
imagination it seemed as if some human form lay
sprawled across the bed.</p>

<p>Raising the sheets, she ran her hands back and
forth over the mattress as far as she could reach.
No rustle of papers, such as she had hoped to hear,
resulted. Looking about, she spied the short
wooden steps which Miss Susan Baird had used to
mount into bed every night, and dragged them into
place. Standing on the top step and resting her
weight partly on the bed, Nina managed to feel the
whole surface of the mattress.</p>

<p>Finally, she straightened her aching figure and
stood upright. She was conscious of a slight feeling
of giddiness; the next instant she had lost her
balance and rolled to the floor. As she descended
she threw out her hand and instinctively clutched
the valance. It ripped away with a tearing sound,
and when she sat up, bewildered, her eyes were on a
level with the wooden springs of the bed. Between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>them and the mattress rested an oblong box. It was
painted the color of mahogany and fitted snugly
into its cleverly contrived hiding place.</p>

<p>Nina&rsquo;s fingers trembled as she lifted out the box
and tried to raise the cover. It was locked. Scrambling
to her feet, she hurried to the bureau and
selected a steel shoe horn. Slipping it under the
box-lid she exerted all her strength. The lock resisted
her efforts at first, then the rotten wood gave
with a slight splintering sound.</p>

<p>In panting haste she threw back the lid. The box
appeared to be filled with papers of all sizes, but
Nina lost no time in examining them. On top lay a
package of letters bearing her name in a familiar
handwriting. Snatching them up, Nina replaced
the box. With the aid of pins she tacked the valance
back in place as best she could, straightened the
bedclothes, and then stole from the room, her
precious package clasped tightly in her hand. As
she passed down the staircase, she was totally unaware
that she was watched, nor did she catch the
faint sound made by the opening and closing of
&ldquo;Miss Susan&rsquo;s&rdquo; bedroom door.</p>

<p>The fire in the library had been replenished a
short time before by Mandy and it blazed with unaccustomed
brilliancy, and Nina in the overheated
atmosphere felt a return of the giddiness which had
upset her upstairs. Crossing the library, she threw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>open the upper half of the Dutch door. The cool
air refreshed her and she stood enjoying it while her
gaze roved over the garden and its box hedges along
the walks. The flower beds in their winter dress
presented a dreary aspect. But Nina&rsquo;s attention did
not linger upon them; instead it centered upon a man
sitting on one of the stone benches near the sun-dial.
His air of dejection was marked. He turned
ever so slightly and in spite of the soft hat pulled far
down on his forehead and his hunched shoulders,
Nina recognized Leigh Wallace. On impulse she
turned the key in the lower half of the door and
opening it, walked down the path. Her footfall was
noiseless and it was not until she stopped directly in
front of him that Wallace became aware of her
approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nina!&rdquo; The low cry escaped him involuntarily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Her tone stung him like a lash. &ldquo;I
prefer to be addressed as Mrs. Potter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; Wallace grew white to the lips. &ldquo;I
shall respect your wishes. Had I known that you
were here, I would not have come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is perhaps as well that you are here,&rdquo; Nina
took a step forward. &ldquo;It gives me an opportunity
to return these letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wallace looked at the package she held toward
him and then at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You kept them!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;You had the
nerve&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her scornful expression checked him. &ldquo;Comment
is unnecessary,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Take the letters and
destroy them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wallace&rsquo;s uncomprehending stare frightened her.
Was his old failing upon him&mdash;had he been drinking?
For a long minute they regarded each other.
Slowly he put out his hand, took the package, and
without a glance at them or at her turned and walked
away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Inspector Mitchell left Charles Craige to enter
&ldquo;Rose Hill&rdquo; alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in shortly,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Wait until I
get there.&rdquo; And, not waiting to hear even if Craige
made an answer, the Inspector headed for the house
adjoining the Baird mansion on the east. Craige
paused a second to give an order to his chauffeur,
then mounted the long steps to the vestibule where
Mandy stood awaiting his arrival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I done see&rsquo;d yo&rsquo; comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she remarked, closing
the door with a bang. &ldquo;Go right in de lib&rsquo;ry, Mister
Charles. I&rsquo;ll tell Miss Kitty yo&rsquo; am hyar jes&rsquo; as
soon as my gran&rsquo;son gets back from the sto&rsquo;.&rdquo; And
Mandy resumed her place in the parlor window
from whence she could obtain an unobstructed view
up and down Q Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>Craige&rsquo;s heavy footsteps did not cause a man,
standing in front of the open Dutch door in the
library, to turn around, so fixed was his attention on
the view into the garden. Craige paused just over
the threshold of the library door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, hello, Ben!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
you were here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a convulsive start, Ben Potter swung around
and Craige recoiled a step or two. The rage
stamped on Potter&rsquo;s countenance had distorted it
almost beyond recognition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; Craige ejaculated. &ldquo;Ben,
what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter passed a hand across his face and with an
effort regained some semblance of self-control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Kitty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Craige&rsquo;s astonishment
increased. &ldquo;Probably upstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter brushed past him without a word and disappeared
into the hall. Craige advanced farther
into the library and paused in indecision. From
where he stood he faced the Dutch door, the upper
half of which stood open, and thus had an uninterrupted
view of the garden.</p>

<p>It did not need remarkably keen eyesight to recognize
the man and woman standing near the sun-dial.
Craige stared at the tableau for fully a minute, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>turned thoughtfully away just as Leigh Wallace
took the package from Nina Potter.</p>

<p>Kitty, awakened from her sleep by Ben Potter&rsquo;s
unceremonious entrance into her bedroom, was gazing
at her cousin in utter bewilderment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; she demanded for the
second time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That your revolver was found by Inspector Mitchell
on the floor of Ted Rodgers&rsquo; car,&rdquo; repeated
Potter. He made no attempt to modify his angry
tones and his voice carried through the open door
and across the hall into Ted Rodgers&rsquo; bedroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mad!&rdquo; exclaimed Kitty. &ldquo;My revolver
is here in my desk.&rdquo; Springing up she hastened to
her antique secretary and pulled open one of the
drawers. It was empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The revolver was here yesterday,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And last night in Ted&rsquo;s car,&rdquo; reiterated Potter,
with stubborn temper. &ldquo;Your revolver&mdash;and one
chamber had been recently discharged and Ted Rodgers
nearly killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As his words echoed across the hall Miss Gray,
the trained nurse, closed the bedroom door and
turned to look at her patient. With feeble strength
he struggled upright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring me my clothes,&rdquo; Ted Rodgers gasped, as
she hurried to his side.</p>

MOUCHETTE, THE SEVEN-TOED</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> Nina Potter reëntered the library a
few minutes later she found Charles
Craige playing with the Angora cat,
Mouchette. With a word of greeting she moved
over to the fire and held out her hands before the
blaze. Craige, who had risen at sight of her, observed
her effort to avoid his gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel chilled,&rdquo; she confessed, and a shiver shook
her from head to foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a bad cold,&rdquo; Craige remarked. &ldquo;Was
it wise to linger in the garden&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nina, intent on her own thoughts, never noticed
the gravity of his manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; she admitted absently. &ldquo;I should
have remembered my coat. Where is Kitty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upstairs, I imagine. Your husband went to find
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben!&rdquo; Nina whirled around. &ldquo;Ben&mdash;here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out, you will scorch yourself,&rdquo; Craige
stepped hastily toward her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand so near
the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in no danger&mdash;&rdquo; but Nina drew away from
the fireplace with a paler face. &ldquo;How long have you
been in the library, Mr. Craige?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was Ben here with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found him here when I arrived. Do sit down,
Mrs. Potter, you look utterly fagged,&rdquo; and Craige
wheeled forward a chair. As she still remained
standing he started to remonstrate, but the words
died on his lips as Kitty came into the room, followed
by Ben Potter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven you are here,&rdquo; she cried, running
to her godfather&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;You will bring Ben to his
senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potter walked up to them, his eyes ablaze with
anger. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told her a few plain truths,&rdquo; he stated.
His truculent manner made anything but an agreeable
impression on Craige, who viewed him with contempt.
He had no use for bullies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop shouting, Ben,&rdquo; he remarked cuttingly.
&ldquo;You forget you are addressing your cousin and
your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nina moved slightly to one side and looked at
her husband. Upon his entrance she had shrunk
behind Craige. The movement had been instinctive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you so excited, dear?&rdquo; she asked, timidly.</p>

<p>Potter avoided her gaze and addressed Craige.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of mysteries,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;First, Cousin
Susan is murdered, brutally murdered, poor old
lady; then my friend, Ted Rodgers, is shot while
driving in his own car with Kitty&mdash;and Kitty&rsquo;s revolver,
with one chamber discharged, is found in the
car. Damn it!&rdquo; His teeth clenched together. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
time the police took action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will, never worry&mdash;&rdquo; Inspector Mitchell,
who had been an interested spectator of the scene
from the doorway, stepped inside the library, his
face set and stern. &ldquo;Allow me to conduct this investigation
in my own way, Mr. Potter. Stand
aside, sir.&rdquo; He turned to address some one in the
hall. &ldquo;Welsh, go tell Major Wallace that he will
find Miss Baird here and not in the parlor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wallace!&rdquo; Potter faced about. &ldquo;Is he still
hanging around here? Why don&rsquo;t you throw him
out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Major Wallace has a perfect right to come here
if he wishes to.&rdquo; Kitty spoke with warmth. &ldquo;How
dare you, Ben, dictate who shall call here and who
shall not? This is my house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; Potter had lashed himself into a fury&mdash;a
fury apparently intensified by the arrival of Leigh
Wallace, for he turned and shook his fist at the
young officer. &ldquo;As your nearest of kin, Kitty, I
insist that your aunt&rsquo;s wishes be carried out and that
you shall not receive Wallace again. She knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>what character of man he is&mdash;and that knowledge
was the cause of her death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige stepped forward. &ldquo;Are you aware of what
you are saying, Ben?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;That you virtually
accuse Major Wallace of killing Miss Susan
Baird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Potter laughed recklessly. &ldquo;Miss Baird
had proof of his treachery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Treachery? To whom?&rdquo; Craige&rsquo;s hand on
Kitty&rsquo;s shoulder warned her to be silent as he shot
his questions at the distraught naturalist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Kitty&mdash;playing fast and loose with her affections,
and holding clandestine meetings with&mdash;&rdquo;
Potter licked his dry mouth, while his eyes, inflamed
with hate, rested on Wallace&rsquo;s white face, &ldquo;with my
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; The denial rang out clearly. Only
Inspector Mitchell&rsquo;s powerful arm prevented Wallace
from springing on Potter. &ldquo;You d&mdash;mn
scoundrel, to blacken your wife&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; Nina Potter wrung her hands.
&ldquo;You are both mad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This scene has gone far enough!&rdquo; Craige spoke
with authority. His calmness brought some comfort
to Kitty&mdash;they were not all losing their heads!
&ldquo;Quiet, Potter. Now, Mitchell, what have you to
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inspector Mitchell surveyed the small circle with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>critical eyes. He noted Nina Potter, standing white-faced
and terror-stricken, her gaze riveted on her
infuriated husband. Kitty, bewilderment struggling
with dawning horror as she stared at her cousin and
his young wife and then at Wallace, had sunk down
on the nearest chair. Wallace, his eyes downcast,
stood swaying on his feet. Mitchell glanced at
Craige and pointed slightly to Wallace. It was
plain to both men that the young officer had been
drinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we sit down,&rdquo; Mitchell indicated the
chairs about the tea table, and taking their consent
for granted, deliberately seated himself. With some
hesitancy, Potter followed his example and Wallace
did so mechanically. Nina Potter, her feet dragging
as she stumbled nearer, half fell into an armchair
and Craige took the vacant one by Kitty&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Draw up,&rdquo; Mitchell directed. &ldquo;I will lay my
cards on the table&mdash;and then, Mr. Potter,&rdquo; as the
naturalist started to speak, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll hear what you
have to say. Until then, keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell spoke in a tone which commanded respect
and Potter sullenly obeyed him. The silence
remained unbroken for a tense moment, then the
portières were drawn aside and Welsh, the plain
clothes detective, stuck his head inside the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Parsons,&rdquo; he announced, and drew back to
let her enter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>Half way across the library the pretty widow
paused and inspected the company assembled around
the tea table in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Kitty,&rdquo; she said, dropping her lorgnette.
&ldquo;I stopped only for a minute,&rdquo; she hesitated.
&ldquo;I fear I am <i>de trop</i>,&rdquo; and she turned to leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it.&rdquo; Mitchell spoke so quickly that
Kitty, who had risen, had no opportunity to answer
Mrs. Parsons. The instinct of courtesy gained
ascendancy over her perturbed spirit, and she offered
her chair to the pretty widow. &ldquo;Join us here, Mrs.
Parsons,&rdquo; added Mitchell. &ldquo;We want your advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; smile was charming, but her eyes
were keenly alert as she moved forward, searching
each face for a clue to the scene which she felt she
had interrupted. Not observing where she was going,
she stepped on something soft. A loud wail
from Mouchette caused her to start convulsively,
and the Angora cat, switching her injured tail, back
and forth, sprang on Kitty&rsquo;s vacant chair and from
there to the tea table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cat is always under my feet, horrid beast!&rdquo;
Mrs. Parsons, conscious of appearing ridiculous, for
Wallace had not restrained a chuckle, spoke with
irritation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me help you,&rdquo; and Craige, who with the
other men had risen on the widow&rsquo;s entrance, assisted
her in removing her wrap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons presented an alluring picture in her
chic crêpe de Chine calling costume, its soft folds
showing her graceful figure to advantage. Mrs.
Parsons, with reason, was vain of her neck and arms
and generally wore elbow sleeves and square cut
neck. She was making a round of visits, and as she
removed her long white gloves, she laid her gold
card case and mesh bag before her on the tea table.</p>

<p>Mouchette eyed them for a second and then put
out an inquisitive paw. Mrs. Parsons promptly
drew both bag and card case out of the cat&rsquo;s reach.
Craige, who missed nothing the widow either said
or did, lifted Mouchette off the table and held her on
his knee. He was aware of Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; fear of
cats. Mouchette submitted to his petting with good
grace and much purring, and finally curled up in his
lap, but her yellow eyes never ceased watching Mrs.
Parsons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this a séance?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Parsons as the
silence continued. &ldquo;If not,&rdquo; her eyebrows lifted,
&ldquo;why are we sitting around this table?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are waiting for Inspector Mitchell to, as he
expressed it, &lsquo;lay his cards on the table,&rsquo;&rdquo; Potter
spoke with a sneer. &ldquo;In other words, Cecelia, you
are in at the death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; slight start was lost on all but
Craige.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drop the melodrama, Ben,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>fer
to listen to Inspector Mitchell and not to you. Go
on, Inspector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Inspector was doomed to another interruption,
for as he hitched his chair closer to Nina
Potter, the sound of footsteps in the gallery circling
the library drew all eyes upward. With the aid of
his nurse, Ted Rodgers was making his way down
the gallery steps with faltering speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t any one rise,&rdquo; he begged, as they started
to their feet. Kitty was the first to reach his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ted, is this wise, dear?&rdquo; she asked, making no
attempt to conceal her anxiety. &ldquo;How could you
let him get up, Miss Gray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t help herself.&rdquo; Rodgers gently but
firmly disengaged his hand from Kitty&rsquo;s tender
clasp. &ldquo;Go and sit down, dear; I&rsquo;ll take this chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Gray aided him in pulling out the throne-shaped
chair. By tacit consent the others had
avoided sitting in it. As Rodgers sank back, the
bandage on his head showed up plainly. Leigh Wallace
transferred his gaze elsewhere. Vividly before
him had loomed the memory of Miss Susan lying
dead in her throne-shaped chair on Monday morning.
Rodgers&rsquo; complexion matched the dead woman&rsquo;s
in pallor. His exertions had made him deadly
faint and it was some seconds before he could gather
his strength to speak with clearness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait, Miss Gray,&rdquo; he said courteously.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>&ldquo;They will call you if I need your aid. Thank you.&rdquo;
Then as the nurse withdrew, he turned to Inspector
Mitchell. &ldquo;Well, what news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Baird,&rdquo; Mitchell cleared his throat and
pointed to a typewritten manuscript which he had
lain before him on the table just as Rodgers joined
them. &ldquo;You quarreled with your aunt on Sunday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had an argument, I admit&mdash;&rdquo; Kitty rubbed
one nervous hand over the other&mdash;they were both
cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was more than an argument&mdash;it was a quarrel,
and about Major Leigh Wallace,&rdquo; Mitchell&rsquo;s manner
was dictatorial. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t contradict me, madam,
I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what else do you know?&rdquo; demanded
Craige, losing patience. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that document you
have there, Mitchell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All in good time, sir.&rdquo; Mitchell&rsquo;s smile was tantalizing.
&ldquo;You went out of here, Miss Baird, in a
rage, because your aunt had ordered you not to
return. Can you deny it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a moment,&rdquo; Craige held up his hand. &ldquo;You
are not obliged to answer these questions, Kitty, except
in a law court. Don&rsquo;t overstep your authority,
Mitchell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell&rsquo;s only answer was to shrug his heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>shoulders, and look across the table at Kitty. &ldquo;Miss
Baird,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;You purchased some peaches
for Mrs. Parsons on Saturday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him dumbly. Then at Mrs. Parsons,
who gazed back at her in silent astonishment.
&ldquo;I bought some fruit for her on Saturday,&rdquo; she admitted.
&ldquo;But if there were any peaches in the basket,
they were there unknown to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell smiled significantly. &ldquo;Pretty thin,&rdquo; he
commented, and glanced over at Craige, before
again addressing her. &ldquo;You stopped to see Mrs.
Parsons on Sunday morning, Miss Baird&mdash;and you
brought those peaches home to your aunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not!&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s voice rang out clearly. &ldquo;I
was at Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; for a few minutes on Sunday
on my way from church&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With Major Wallace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty changed color. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Major Wallace went into the house with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty paused in uncertainty and her eyes sought
Wallace. He sat lolling back in his chair, his air of
indifference plainly assumed as his restless fingers
played with the catch of Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; gold mesh
bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went upstairs to see Mrs. Parsons,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;I left Major Wallace standing in the
vestibule&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And the front door open&mdash;&rdquo; Mitchell broke in
rudely. He turned to Mrs. Parsons. &ldquo;Your house
is an English basement, with the drawing room on
the second floor. Where is your dining room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the first floor.&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons had been following
the dialogue with unwavering attention. At
her answer Mitchell nodded his head with an air
of triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll amend my statement, Miss Baird,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You did not carry those peaches home to your aunt,
but Major Wallace did&mdash;when he called here to see
her alone on Sunday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wallace&rsquo;s air of indifference dropped from him
and he swung to his feet, his hands clenched.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a damned liar!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouting won&rsquo;t help matters,&rdquo; Mitchell remarked.
&ldquo;For I have the goods on you.&rdquo; He tapped
the papers in front of him. &ldquo;Here is the sworn
testimony of Mrs. Murray, who saw you enter this
house on Sunday afternoon with a paper package
under your arm, and when you left you carried no
package and were so agitated that you weren&rsquo;t even
conscious of bumping into Mrs. Murray as you hurried
down the street toward Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wallace stared at the Inspector and then at the
others, but always his eyes passed over Nina Potter,
sitting huddled in her chair, her eyes upraised in
mute pleading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; his voice was hoarse&mdash;discordant. &ldquo;What
if I did bring some peaches to Miss Susan as a
&lsquo;peace offering?&rsquo;&rdquo; His lips twitched into a ghastly
smile. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t follow that I murdered her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;?&rdquo; Mitchell&rsquo;s tone expressed incredulity.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for the jury to decide.&rdquo; He looked across
at Kitty. &ldquo;You I charge with being an accessory
to the crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charles Craige was the first to speak. &ldquo;You
bring a serious charge against my godchild,&rdquo; he said
sternly. &ldquo;I demand your proof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell turned slightly to address the man on his
left. &ldquo;How about it, Mr. Potter?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Potter seemed to have some difficulty in speaking,
for a moment elapsed before he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kitty spent Sunday night with us,&rdquo; he began.
&ldquo;I came home late, having been detained at my club,
and was surprised to see Kitty walk out of my
apartment house and jump into Major Wallace&rsquo;s
car&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got no further. Kitty was on her feet, her
face scarlet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You saw me?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; meeting her gaze unwaveringly. &ldquo;I recognized
your red coat.&rdquo; He paused, then added
slowly, &ldquo;I followed you to Georgetown and saw you
enter this house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty dropped back in her chair as if shot. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>eyes wandered from Nina Potter, sitting with head
averted, to Wallace, who stared straight in front of
him, and then to Ted Rodgers, who sat with closed
eyes, his head resting against the high back of the
throne-shaped chair. No one broke the tense silence
and after a brief pause Mitchell spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got your aunt&rsquo;s fortune, Miss Baird&mdash;and
then you got cold feet&mdash;&rdquo; he paused dramatically.
&ldquo;There was one man who suspected you, and so you
tried to do away with him. I found your revolver,
with one chamber discharged in the bottom of Mr.
Rodgers&rsquo; car&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I have heard,&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s fighting spirit was
coming to her aid. It had conquered her feeling of
deadly faintness, and she faced them, white-lipped
but with blazing eyes. &ldquo;And who was with you,
Inspector, when you made that discovery?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My chauffeur and Mr. Potter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s smile was peculiar as she
glanced at her cousin. &ldquo;Has it occurred to you that
it may be manufactured evidence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell looked at her in astonishment. &ldquo;Are you
accusing your cousin of lying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is accusing me of a far more despicable
crime,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;Of wilfully aiding in the
murder of my aunt, of trying to kill the man whom,
last night, I promised to marry&mdash;&rdquo; she faced them
proudly, her heart beating with suffocating rapidity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>Why, why had not Ted Rodgers spoken in her defense?
&ldquo;Mr. Rodgers,&rdquo; she went on, after an almost
imperceptible pause, &ldquo;was shot by a person
riding in a car which passed us when we were driving
in Rock Creek Park last night. When I left
this house with Mr. Rodgers, my revolver was upstairs
in the drawer of my desk&mdash;&rdquo; Again she
paused, finding speech difficult&mdash;her throat felt
parched and dry. &ldquo;Upon my return I found not only
you waiting for me, Inspector Mitchell, but Mr. Potter.
My cousin knew where I kept my revolver; it
was no secret. He could easily have slipped upstairs
during the confusion of getting Mr. Rodgers to bed
and sending for a nurse and doctor, secured my revolver
and, unknown to you, dropped it in Mr.
Rodgers&rsquo; car&mdash;for the purpose of incriminating me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Potter&rsquo;s object in doing that?&rdquo; questioned
Mitchell, as she came to a breathless pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask him&mdash;&rdquo; and Kitty pointed to her cousin, who
had half risen, then dropped back in his chair.
Mitchell stared at them both for a second, then faced
the throne-shaped chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell us who shot you, Mr. Rodgers?&rdquo; he</p>

<p>Rodgers opened his eyes and faced their concentrated
attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Baird,&rdquo; he commenced, and Kitty almost
cried out at the formality of his address, &ldquo;has told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>you how the revolver might have been &lsquo;planted&rsquo; in
my car to incriminate her. To be exact it was
thrown into the car by the person who shot me, and
with it a handkerchief.&rdquo; He fumbled in his pocket
and pulled out a piece of linen, bloodstained and
torn. &ldquo;You bound my head, did you not, before you
started to drive me home?&rdquo; turning to Kitty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My nurse&mdash;&rdquo; Rodgers was speaking more clearly,
&ldquo;showed me the handkerchiefs which Dr. McLean
had removed to put on a proper bandage,&rdquo;
touching his head. &ldquo;Look at that handkerchief,
Mitchell&mdash;and tell us what you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell spread out the costly linen so that all
could view it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s handkerchief,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an initial in the corner&mdash;the letter&mdash;&rdquo; holding
it closer&mdash;&ldquo;the letter &lsquo;P.&rsquo;&rdquo; In the utter stillness
that followed he laid down the handkerchief.
&ldquo;&lsquo;P,&rsquo;&rdquo; he repeated musingly&mdash;&ldquo;Potter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cry escaped Nina Potter and she shrank back
in her chair, her face buried in her hands, shaking
from head to foot. &ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Not
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ted Rodgers bent forward. &ldquo;&lsquo;P&rsquo; stands as well
for &lsquo;Parsons,&rsquo;&rdquo; he commented, and got no further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;se done said it!&rdquo; gasped a voice behind them,
and Oscar, perspiration trickling down his black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>face, came forward, his arm tightly clutched by
Welsh, the plain clothes&rsquo; detective. &ldquo;Dar&rsquo;s de woman
who done up ole Miss,&rdquo; shaking his fist in Mrs.
Parsons&rsquo; face. &ldquo;I see&rsquo;d her acreepin&rsquo; away from
here on Monday mawnin,&rsquo; an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;Oscar!&rdquo; Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; voice rose
and cracked. Again she tried to speak in her natural
tones&mdash;&ldquo;Oscar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty cried out&mdash;a chord of memory had been
touched&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was you I heard trying to bribe Oscar!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons turned with livid face to Charles
Craige.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charles&mdash;they&mdash;she&mdash;stop her!&rdquo; She reeled
backward and Craige, awakening from his stupor,
flung Mouchette toward Kitty and reached forward
to catch Mrs. Parsons as she swayed dangerously
near the edge of her chair.</p>

<p>The Angora cat, roused suddenly from her sleep,
missed Kitty by the fraction of an inch and alighted
in Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; lap. As the terrified woman attempted
to throw her down, the cat sank her claws
into her bare arm, tearing the delicate flesh with
gash after gash.</p>

<p>The men sprang to Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; aid, but too
late. Her screams gave place to a gurgling cry and
she sank back a dead weight. Mitchell, kneeling by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>her side, stared at her convulsed features in horror
as his hand went to her wrist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By God! She&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; he gasped in awe. His
glance traveled downward. &ldquo;Look&mdash;look at the
cat!&rdquo; His shaking finger pointed to where Mouchette
sat licking first one paw and then the other.
A streak of blood was flowing from where she had
gashed herself in her fury. Suddenly they saw the
cat stiffen, throw back her head convulsively, roll
over and lie still.</p>

<p>A clicking sound caused Inspector Mitchell to
whirl around in time to see a pair of handcuffs dangling
from Charles Craige&rsquo;s wrists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charles Craige&mdash;murderer of Miss Susan
Baird,&rdquo; explained Rodgers. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; and a
revolver rested dangerously near Craige&rsquo;s heart.
&ldquo;Open your hand.&rdquo; The command was accompanied
by a threatening movement of the revolver.</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly Craige did as he was told.
A small rubber bulb syringe dropped to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch it,&rdquo; Rodgers cried sharply, as Mitchell
bent down. &ldquo;It is filled with the poison which
Craige sprayed on the cat&rsquo;s paw&mdash;and thus killed
Cecelia Parsons, his fiancée.&rdquo;</p>

GREED</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smcap">harles Craige</span> sat staring into vacancy,
while beads of perspiration trickled
down his ghastly face. Several drops
slipped into his eyes and half blinded him. Raising
his hands he brushed them away. The action
brought the handcuffs encircling his wrists into
view. He regarded them apathetically, then his
uncomprehending gaze traveled over the horror-stricken
men and women grouped about his chair.
It was not until he saw Kitty Baird that the situation
dawned upon him. Before the others suspected
his intention, he sprang at her, his manacled hands
upraised to strike. The blow was turned aside by
Inspector Mitchell, who darted to Kitty&rsquo;s assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold him down in that chair, Welsh,&rdquo; he directed
as the detective came to his aid. Rodgers,
whose false strength had departed, dropped into the
nearest chair, the revolver hanging useless in his
grasp. His shot, as Craige sprang forward, had
gone wild. Kitty was by his side in an instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he panted, as she bent over him.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, my darling. Now, Craige, what
have you to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say?&rdquo; Craige was winded from his exertions
and spoke with difficulty. &ldquo;Why should I say anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the game&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; Mitchell stated, and
stepped aside so that Craige had a clear view of
Cecelia Parsons. &ldquo;Why did you kill that woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to kill Cecelia,&rdquo; Craige shouted.
&ldquo;God knows I did not.&rdquo; His bloodshot eyes again
sought Kitty. &ldquo;I threw the cat at you. Cecelia
called to me to stop you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, so Mrs. Parsons aided you in your murder
of Miss Susan Baird,&rdquo; broke in Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did not.&rdquo; Craige, his tongue unloosened,
spoke in desperate haste, his words tripping over
one another. It seemed almost as if he gained courage
from the sound of his own voice. &ldquo;Miss Susan
Baird was warned&mdash;but she would not listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you kill my aunt?&rdquo; demanded Kitty,
indignation for the moment mastering her horror.
&ldquo;She was always kind to you. She trusted you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust? It was greed which prompted her friendship.&rdquo;
Craige laughed harshly, jeeringly. &ldquo;It was
by my aid that she made her fortune. Do you know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>what she was&mdash;your aristocratic aunt&mdash;a money-lender!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty stared at him&mdash;appalled. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; she
cried, and turned appealingly to Ted Rodgers.
&ldquo;Make him tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am speaking the truth,&rdquo; Craige retorted.
&ldquo;Many&rsquo;s the person I&rsquo;ve brought over here when
you, Kitty, were not around, and your aunt has
admitted us at that side door. She charged high
rates of interest, but no one gave her away. She
was square with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you square with her?&rdquo; asked Rodgers
quietly, and a dull red suffused Craige&rsquo;s white face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I had to borrow, she treated me like the
others,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The fact that I helped her
amass a fortune cut no ice. I got deeper and deeper
in debt, and then&mdash;&rdquo; his voice changed. &ldquo;I had to
have money, so I told her I wanted to marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty retreated, aghast. &ldquo;Marry me? <i>You!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; coolly. &ldquo;I am only fifty-four; there is not
such a difference in our ages. I saw your aunt on
Sunday about six o&rsquo;clock. She laughed at me and
refused to consent to our marriage.&rdquo; Beads of perspiration
had again gathered on his forehead, but he
went steadily on with his story, oblivious apparently
of the abhorrence with which his companions were
regarding him. &ldquo;I had forged Miss Susan Baird&rsquo;s
name in my desperation last week. I knew that if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>Kitty and I were married quickly, she would keep
quiet about the forgery for her family&rsquo;s sake. When
she laughed my plan to scorn, I realized there was
only one thing to do&mdash;to kill her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you go about it?&rdquo; asked Mitchell.</p>

<p>It was some seconds before Craige answered. &ldquo;I
went prepared for failure,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I could
not face ruin&mdash;perhaps the penitentiary for forgery.
My father was a famous expert in toxicology and,&rdquo;
he moistened his lips&mdash;&ldquo;I often worked in his
laboratory,&rdquo; with a side glance at the bulb syringe
still lying where it had fallen on the floor. &ldquo;I at
first planned to squeeze some poison in her tea cup,
but got no chance. Then Miss Baird asked me to
peel a peach for her. I don&rsquo;t know where the
peaches came from, but there were three in a dish on
the table. Before cutting the peach in two, I sprayed
some hydrocyanic acid on the knife-blade when Miss
Baird was not looking, holding the knife just over
the edge of the table and the bulb in my left hand,
out of sight in my lap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was devilishly ingenious,&rdquo; commented Mitchell.
&ldquo;Well, did you steal the forged paper after
killing the old lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Craige looked at Kitty with a faint sneer.
&ldquo;It was among those canceled checks from the bank
which you so obligingly left in your desk yesterday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>alongside your revolver. I stole them both last
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last night?&rdquo; Kitty looked at him in astonishment.
&ldquo;Why, we found you at home last night, Ted
and I. We telephoned you first that we were coming
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I answered the &rsquo;phone; quite so.&rdquo; Craige&rsquo;s smile
was peculiar. &ldquo;My butler, Lambert, is well trained
and,&rdquo; with emphasis, &ldquo;well paid. He is quick at
recognizing the voices of my intimate friends. I
happened to be in Washington in my, eh, town
apartment,&rdquo; with a sidelong look at Kitty. &ldquo;From
there I have a direct wire to my switchboard in my
house, and Lambert plugged in your call. You
thought you were talking to me at &lsquo;Hideaway,&rsquo; Rodgers,
whereas I wasn&rsquo;t six blocks away from here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told Lambert to take care of you until I got
home, then hurried over here. I have a key to the
side door. It took but an instant to slip upstairs
to your room and to go through your desk. Mandy
never woke up, but that infernal cat,&rdquo; with a vindictive
snarl. &ldquo;I wish I had strangled her. When
I got back to &lsquo;Hideaway,&rsquo; I found you and Kitty so
engaged with each other that I knew you never realized
the time I took to appear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that was it!&rdquo; Rodgers drew a long breath.
&ldquo;And you followed us and tried to shoot me in the
Park!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Craige favored him with a scowl. &ldquo;I
got word yesterday that you were wise to the kind
of life I was leading&mdash;you knew too much. I detected
you watching me last night. If Kitty had not
swerved her car when she did, I&rsquo;d have potted you,
for I&rsquo;m a crack shot as a general thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did you throw the revolver into the car as
you dashed by?&rdquo; asked Kitty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I had tied a handkerchief loosely about
the butt of the revolver so as not to leave finger
prints,&rdquo; Craige added. &ldquo;It was clever of you, Rodgers,
to trace the handkerchief as you did. In my
haste that night, I never noticed that I had one of
Cecelia&rsquo;s handkerchiefs in my pocket and none of my
own.&rdquo; He paused, his voice had grown husky.
&ldquo;Well, that clears up the mystery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All but Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; part in it,&rdquo; broke in Rodgers.
&ldquo;Where did she come in, Craige?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige&rsquo;s color mounted, then receded, leaving him
deadly white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She cut a big splurge here,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;and soon
went through her money. She found out about
Miss Baird and came here early Monday morning,
knowing that Kitty was spending the night with her
cousins, hoping to borrow from Susan. She found
the front door open, so she told me, and walked in.
When she discovered Miss Baird lying dead in the
library, she bolted home and called up the police.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And why did she try to bribe Oscar?&rdquo; demanded
Kitty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wanted some papers to prove that your aunt
was a money-lender,&rdquo; Craige twisted about, his
growing uneasiness plainly indicated by his avoidance
of their gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; cut in Mitchell. &ldquo;Mrs. Parsons
hoped to blackmail Miss Kitty Baird by threatening
to expose her aunt&rsquo;s career.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige nodded sullenly. &ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo;
he admitted.</p>

<p>Rodgers had not taken his eyes from him. &ldquo;Did
Mrs. Parsons know that you wished to marry
Kitty?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Craige shifted his feet about. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she know that you killed Miss Susan
Baird?&rdquo; Rodgers was persistent in his questioning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; Craige glanced up at him quickly,
then dropped his eyes. The sight of his handcuffs
sent a shiver down his spine and he again shifted his
gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Parsons done picked up dat ar&rsquo; rubber ball
befo&rsquo; she left on Monday mawnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; volunteered
Oscar. The old man had been a fascinated witness
of all that transpired; his face, gray from fright at
the death of Cecelia Parsons, had regained its nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>mal
hue somewhat, but his eyes still bulged from
his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did!&rdquo; A startled look crept into Craige&rsquo;s
ever shifting eyes. &ldquo;Why, I found the cat playing
with the syringe when I first entered this room. I
knew that I had dropped it on Sunday, probably
when I reëntered the library after Susan Baird
screamed.&rdquo; A shudder shook him, in spite of his
iron self-control. &ldquo;Seeing it here this afternoon, I
supposed it had rolled in some corner, and been overlooked.
I judged that the cat had selected it as a
plaything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder the cat didn&rsquo;t poison herself,&rdquo; commented
Mitchell.</p>

<p>Craige&rsquo;s face was distorted into what he meant
for a smile. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t a drop of poison left in
the syringe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I considered finding it a
direct act of Providence, for I expected trouble of
some kind, and brought with me a small phial of a
concentrated solution of crotalidae&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snake venom, and deadly when introduced into
the blood,&rdquo; explained Craige. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sometimes used
in drugs given by homeopathists. During the few
minutes I was alone in the library I put the poison
in the syringe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if Mrs. Parsons carried away the syringe on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>Monday morning, how did it get back in this library
to-day?&rdquo; asked Kitty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She probably guessed that it was used to kill
Miss Susan Baird in some way, and brought it back
to incriminate Miss Kitty Baird,&rdquo; declared Mitchell.
&ldquo;Mrs. Parsons was as clever as they make
them, but she overreached herself when she tried to
involve you, Mr. Rodgers. I kept the wires to San
Francisco hot until I found out that the papers she
produced to prove that you were involved in the
Holt will forgery were ones found in Gentleman
Jake&rsquo;s house, when he and his confederates were
trying to forge Holt&rsquo;s will.&rdquo; He turned to Craige.
&ldquo;Did you put Mrs. Parsons up to that deviltry, Mr.
Craige?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige ignored the question and Potter broke his
long silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I imagine he did,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mrs. Parsons was
the divorced wife of Gentleman Jake, and later she
married Amos Parsons. He left some property and
she came east. She&rsquo;d have lived straight, Craige, if
it hadn&rsquo;t been for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Craige,&rdquo; Mitchell&rsquo;s harsh voice made the lawyer
turn with a nervous jump. &ldquo;Did you conceal that
small bottle of prussic acid in the ivory dice cup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sullenly, then with a venomous glance at
Kitty. &ldquo;I hoped to involve you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You yellow devil!&rdquo; Ted Rodgers rose and
stepped toward him, but Mitchell intervened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The law will deal with him, Mr. Rodgers; stand
back, Sir. Now, Craige, come on&mdash;&rdquo; and, at a sign,
Welsh, the detective, took his place by the lawyer.</p>

<p>Twice Craige tried to get upon his feet, only to
sway back into his seat. He had aged in the past
hour, and when he finally stood upright his shoulders
sagged forward and his trembling knees seemed
unable to support him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch him on the other side, Welsh,&rdquo; Mitchell
directed. &ldquo;Mr. Potter, please telephone to Coroner
Penfield.&rdquo; With a jerk of his head he indicated the
prone figure behind them. &ldquo;Mrs. Parsons cannot be
moved until he gets here. Come, Craige.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craige moved forward a few hesitating steps and
then halted. An irresistible attraction which he
could not conquer drew his eyes toward Cecelia Parsons.
Whatever emotion he felt he controlled admirably.
He stood for a moment motionless, then,
without glancing to right or left, he squared his
shoulders and swinging around strode arrogantly
from the library, the two men on either side walking
rapidly to keep up with him.</p>

<p>The silence in the library grew oppressive and
Kitty was conscious of a feeling almost of nausea
when Nina Potter came toward her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; she said brokenly. &ldquo;I did you a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>great wrong when I wore your red coat to come here
on Sunday night with Leigh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you not do your husband a greater wrong?&rdquo;
Kitty asked swiftly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Nina flushed scarlet. &ldquo;I am a coward,
but I am a loyal wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am entirely to blame,&rdquo; Leigh Wallace turned
and addressed Potter directly. &ldquo;I was once engaged
to your wife. We quarreled and she broke it off.
I never saw or heard from her again until we met
this winter. Nina would not let me pay her any
attention, so, forgive me, Kitty, I went with you
because I could be with Nina without arousing talk,&rdquo;
he hesitated.</p>

<p>No one spoke, and, after an instant&rsquo;s pause, Wallace
continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Saturday night Oscar brought me a note
from Miss Susan Baird asking me to come here
on Sunday at five o&rsquo;clock. I did take the peaches
from Mrs. Parsons&rsquo; table on a silly impulse, for I
knew Miss Baird was fond of them and thought that
I could placate her with a gift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I got here she told me how my father had
jilted her and of her hatred of me. She declared
that she had secured, through bribing one of Nina&rsquo;s
servants, some old love letters of mine&mdash;they were
undated, and she proposed showing them to Ben
Potter. I tried in every way to induce her to return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>them to me, even offering a large sum of money.
She ordered me out of the house,&rdquo; he paused. &ldquo;Then
I went to Nina and asked her to see Miss Baird and
try to get her to give up the letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I came over here with Leigh on Sunday
night,&rdquo; Nina Potter took up the story. &ldquo;Miss Susan
had loaned me your red coat, Kitty, last Wednesday
to wear home when it blew up so cold. The coat is
distinctive in appearance, and&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo; she faltered&mdash;&ldquo;I
knew if any one saw me, there was a chance I
might be mistaken for you. Afterwards I got rid
of the coat by selling it to a second-hand dealer.&rdquo;
She caught her husband&rsquo;s averted gaze and colored
painfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leigh left me at the side door of &lsquo;Rose Hill,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she added. &ldquo;I entered the library&mdash;saw Miss Susan
sitting there&mdash;dead&mdash;&rdquo; she covered her eyes with
her hand as if to shut out some terrifying vision and
a shudder shook her. &ldquo;I must have fainted, for it
was late when I stole out of the house. I left by the
front door, and in my terror I put the big key in the
lock on the outside with some idea of locking poor
Miss Susan in the house. I heard an automobile
coming and ran away, forgetting to turn the key in
the lock after all. When I got home I found Ben
had not gotten in and that you were still asleep,
Kitty&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo; she faltered again and glanced appealingly
at her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>Potter stirred uneasily. &ldquo;I drove around a bit,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Kitty, as I thought, coming over here at
that time of night with Wallace troubled me, and I
wanted time to think things over. When I heard of
Cousin Susan&rsquo;s murder&mdash;well, I&mdash;well, I kept silent
until my jealousy of Wallace drove me to try and
implicate Kitty and him in the crime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you, Ted,&rdquo; he turned to Rodgers, &ldquo;come
out of a second-hand clothing store on Pennsylvania
Avenue with Kitty&rsquo;s coat on your arm. The dealer
told me that you had just paid twenty dollars for it.
I decided that if the coat was worth that to you, it
might be worth double the money to me: so I bribed
the dealer to buy the coat back from you. When
that scheme failed, I went to your apartment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you failed again,&rdquo; broke in Rodgers.
&ldquo;Your coat was accidentally burned up, Kitty, all
except one pocket. In that pocket I found the clue
which gave the first inkling that Charles Craige
might have murdered your aunt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; demanded Kitty breathlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An &lsquo;I.O.U.,&rsquo; which your aunt must have slipped
inside the coat pocket and forgotten. The signature
was obliterated, but I recognized Craige&rsquo;s handwriting,&rdquo;
Rodgers explained. &ldquo;It showed me that Craige
was under heavy financial obligations to Miss Susan
Baird while all the time he protested absolute ignor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>ance
of her wealth. I immediately started to investigate
Craige&rsquo;s career, and it was that investigation,
as he said a few minutes ago, which forced his hand
last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he nearly killed you!&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s eyes were
shining as she faced her lover. &ldquo;You endangered
your life for me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Regardless of the others&rsquo; presence Rodgers drew
her to his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Sweetheart&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; Ben Potter cleared his throat, and
faced the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get your letters, Nina?&rdquo; he asked, turning
to his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not then, only this afternoon,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;I found them in a box under the mattress of Miss
Susan&rsquo;s bed. Mrs. Parsons suspected that I was
searching for something, for yesterday she told me
that for a considerable sum of money she would aid
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That woman was a fiend incarnate!&rdquo; ejaculated
Rodgers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sho&rsquo;ly was, Sah,&rdquo; agreed Oscar. &ldquo;She done
her bes&rsquo; to make me tell de police that ole Miss let
people have money. Yo&rsquo; see, Miss Kitty, ole Miss
had me to help her, an&rsquo; I promised never to tell, an&rsquo;
I never broke my promise, never.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oscar!&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s eyes were dim with tears as she
laid her hand on the faithful servant&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;Where did you disappear yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; went down to my rooms an&rsquo; laid low,&rdquo;
promptly. &ldquo;Mandy an&rsquo; me thought things were gettin&rsquo;
kinda critical &rsquo;round hyar. Las&rsquo; night I heered
yo&rsquo; an&rsquo; Mister Rodgers a-plannin&rsquo; to see Mister
Craige, an&rsquo; then I went home again, scared stiff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, Oscar&mdash;&rdquo; Rodgers interrupted him quickly.
&ldquo;Why did you ask me to find Miss Kitty&rsquo;s red
coat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seen some one a-wearin&rsquo; dat coat enter dis
house as I was passin&rsquo; along de street late Sunday
night,&rdquo; the negro explained. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t swear it
warn&rsquo;t yo&rsquo;, Miss Kitty, an&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t swear it were;
but I calculated dat whoever &rsquo;twas might a lef&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;
in de coat pockets to tell on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a clever thought,&rdquo; exclaimed Rodgers.
&ldquo;But it would have been better had you taken me
entirely into your confidence, Oscar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yessir.&rdquo; But Oscar looked doubtful. &ldquo;I was
mighty concarned &rsquo;bout Miss Kitty, &rsquo;deed I was,
Sah. It warn&rsquo;t &rsquo;till jes&rsquo; a spell back that that detecertif
man, Mister Welsh, who tried to find me in
Front Royal an&rsquo; at las&rsquo; found me to home, &rsquo;splained
to me I had orter be hyar wif yo&rsquo;, Honey, Miss
Kitty, so then I comed round wif him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>Leigh Wallace heard the old man to the end, then
stared moodily across the library. He started for
the doorway and turned around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve destroyed your letters, Nina,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I,
forgive me, I feared that you had killed Miss Susan
Baird on Sunday night. That was why I was so
overcome when the crime was discovered. Mr.
Potter,&rdquo; he spoke with deep feeling. &ldquo;Your wife
loves you devotedly. I am but a forgotten incident
in her life. I received my orders for foreign service
to-day. Good-by.&rdquo; He clicked his heels together
and with a bow which included all in the library,
turned and strode from the room.</p>

<p>At sound of the front door closing, Potter stepped
forward. He was oblivious of any one&rsquo;s presence
but his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nina, can you forgive me?&rdquo; he asked humbly.
&ldquo;I have acted the part of a jealous fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nina&rsquo;s answer was not in words. With a face in
which joy obliterated the shadow of the past few
days, she slipped her arm within his and he led her
from the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doan yo&rsquo; wait hyar, Miss Kitty&mdash;&rdquo; Oscar came
forward a pace. &ldquo;Jes&rsquo; you an&rsquo; Mister Rodgers go
right along. I&rsquo;ll stay wid dis&mdash;&rdquo; and he nodded
significantly at Rodgers. The latter turned to take
a last survey of the library. Not far from Cecelia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>Parsons lay a small furry body&mdash;both were rigid
in death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, sweetheart&mdash;&rdquo; Rodgers slipped his arm
around Kitty and they walked toward the drawing
room. Once there Kitty gave way to the grief consuming
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Aunt Susan&mdash;how could Charles Craige
have had the heart to kill her!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;He
was her trusted friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a man of masks,&rdquo; Rodgers said gravely.
&ldquo;A man of character, well educated, a social favorite
and a brilliant lawyer, but heredity proved too
strong for him.&rdquo; And as Kitty looked at him in
question, he added, &ldquo;Were you not aware that his
father died insane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty shook her head. &ldquo;I never knew it,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;How dreadful! The whole affair&mdash;Aunt
Susan&rsquo;s death&mdash;her life, oh, Ted, her life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; Rodgers laid his finger gently on her
lips. &ldquo;Let us forget the tragedy in our happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Glancing shyly upward, Kitty read the worship in
his eyes and her rapidly beating heart sang a glad
response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All my life I have prayed for love,&rdquo; she murmured
as he took her in his arms; &ldquo;even when I was
only a little lonely child&mdash;and now to feel such hap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>piness
as I never even imagined. To have you with
me always&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In our Kingdom of Love&rdquo;&mdash;Rodgers&rsquo; tender,
caressing voice was melody in her ears&mdash;&ldquo;My queen&mdash;my
queen!&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
